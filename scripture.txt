portion:Genesis 1:1 - 6:8
verse:1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 
verse:1:2 Now the earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep. God's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.
verse:1:3 God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. 
verse:1:4 God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness. 
verse:1:5 God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." There was evening and there was morning, one day.
verse:1:6 God said, "Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters." 
verse:1:7 God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so. 
verse:1:8 God called the expanse "sky." There was evening and there was morning, a second day.
verse:1:9 God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;" and it was so. 
verse:1:10 God called the dry land "earth," and the gathering together of the waters he called "seas." God saw that it was good. 
verse:1:11 God said, "Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed in it, on the earth;" and it was so. 
verse:1:12 The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. 
verse:1:13 There was evening and there was morning, a third day.
verse:1:14 God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years; 
verse:1:15 and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth;" and it was so. 
verse:1:16 God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars. 
verse:1:17 God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth, 
verse:1:18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good. 
verse:1:19 There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
verse:1:20 God said, "Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky." 
verse:1:21 God created the large sea creatures, and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good. 
verse:1:22 God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth." 
verse:1:23 There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
verse:1:24 God said, "Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind;" and it was so. 
verse:1:25 God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good.
verse:1:26 God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth." 
verse:1:27 God created man in his own image. In God's image he created him; male and female he created them. 
verse:1:28 God blessed them. God said to them, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth." 
verse:1:29 God said, "Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food. 
verse:1:30 To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food;" and it was so.
verse:1:31 God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.
verse:2:1 The heavens and the earth were finished, and all their vast array. 
verse:2:2 On the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 
verse:2:3 God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested in it from all his work which he had created and made.
verse:2:4 This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that HASHEM God made the earth and the heavens. 
verse:2:5 No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for HASHEM God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a man to till the ground, 
verse:2:6 but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground. 
verse:2:7 HASHEM God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. 
verse:2:8 HASHEM God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed. 
verse:2:9 Out of the ground HASHEM God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. 
verse:2:10 A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became four heads. 
verse:2:11 The name of the first is Pishon: this is the one which flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 
verse:2:12 and the gold of that land is good. There is aromatic resin and the onyx stone. 
verse:2:13 The name of the second river is Gihon: the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush. 
verse:2:14 The name of the third river is Hiddekel: this is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates. 
verse:2:15 HASHEM God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. 
verse:2:16 HASHEM God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; 
verse:2:17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die."
verse:2:18 HASHEM God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him." 
verse:2:19 Out of the ground HASHEM God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name. 
verse:2:20 The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper suitable for him. 
verse:2:21 HASHEM God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. 
verse:2:22 He made the rib, which HASHEM God had taken from the man, into a woman, and brought her to the man. 
verse:2:23 The man said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called 'woman,' because she was taken out of Man." 
verse:2:24 Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh. 
verse:2:25 They were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
verse:3:1 Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which HASHEM God had made. He said to the woman, "Has God really said, 'You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?'"
verse:3:2 The woman said to the serpent, "Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat, 
verse:3:3 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'"
verse:3:4 The serpent said to the woman, "You won't surely die, 
verse:3:5 for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
verse:3:6 When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit, and ate; and she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate. 
verse:3:7 The eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. 
verse:3:8 They heard the voice of HASHEM God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of HASHEM God among the trees of the garden.
verse:3:9 HASHEM God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?"
verse:3:10 The man said, "I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."
verse:3:11 God said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"
verse:3:12 The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate."
verse:3:13 HASHEM God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?"
The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
verse:3:14 HASHEM God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, you are cursed above all livestock, and above every animal of the field. On your belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life. 
verse:3:15 I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel."
verse:3:16 To the woman he said, "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth. In pain you will bear children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."
verse:3:17 To Adam he said, "Because you have listened to your wife's voice, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground for your sake. In toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. 
verse:3:18 It will yield thorns and thistles to you; and you will eat the herb of the field. 
verse:3:19 By the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For you are dust, and to dust you shall return."
verse:3:20 The man called his wife Havah, because she was the mother of all living. 
verse:3:21 HASHEM God made coats of skins for Adam and for his wife, and clothed them.
verse:3:22 HASHEM God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever..." 
verse:3:23 Therefore HASHEM God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken. 
verse:3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed Cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.
verse:4:1 The man knew Havah his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Cain, and said, "I have gotten a man with HASHEM's help." 
verse:4:2 Again she gave birth, to Cain's brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 
verse:4:3 As time passed, it happened that Cain brought an offering to HASHEM from the fruit of the ground. 
verse:4:4 Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. HASHEM respected Abel and his offering, 
verse:4:5 but he didn't respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell. 
verse:4:6 HASHEM said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen? 
verse:4:7 If you do well, will it not be lifted up? If you don't do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it." 
verse:4:8 Cain said to Abel, his brother, "Let's go into the field." It happened when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.
verse:4:9 HASHEM said to Cain, "Where is Abel, your brother?"
He said, "I don't know. Am I my brother's keeper?"
verse:4:10 HASHEM said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground. 
verse:4:11 Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. 
verse:4:12 From now on, when you till the ground, it won't yield its strength to you. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth."
verse:4:13 Cain said to HASHEM, "My punishment is greater than I can bear. 
verse:4:14 Behold, you have driven me out this day from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. It will happen that whoever finds me will kill me."
verse:4:15 HASHEM said to him, "Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold." HASHEM appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should strike him.
verse:4:16 Cain went out from HASHEM's presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden. 
verse:4:17 Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. 
verse:4:18 To Enoch was born Irad. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech. 
verse:4:19 Lamech took two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 
verse:4:20 Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. 
verse:4:21 His brother's name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe. 
verse:4:22 Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. Tubal Cain's sister was Naamah. 
verse:4:23 Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice. You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech, for I have slain a man for wounding me, a young man for bruising me. 
verse:4:24 If Cain will be avenged seven times, truly Lamech seventy-seven times."
verse:4:25 Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, "for God has appointed me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him." 
verse:4:26 There was also born a son to Seth, and he named him Enosh. Then men began to call on HASHEM's name.
verse:5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him in God's likeness. 
verse:5:2 He created them male and female, and blessed them, and called their name "Adam," in the day when they were created. 
verse:5:3 Adam lived one hundred thirty years, and became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth. 
verse:5:4 The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years, and he became the father of sons and daughters. 
verse:5:5 All the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years, then he died.
verse:5:6 Seth lived one hundred five years, and became the father of Enosh. 
verse:5:7 Seth lived after he became the father of Enosh eight hundred seven years, and became the father of sons and daughters. 
verse:5:8 All the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years, then he died.
verse:5:9 Enosh lived ninety years, and became the father of Kenan. 
verse:5:10 Enosh lived after he became the father of Kenan, eight hundred fifteen years, and became the father of sons and daughters. 
verse:5:11 All the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years, then he died.
verse:5:12 Kenan lived seventy years, and became the father of Mahalalel. 
verse:5:13 Kenan lived after he became the father of Mahalalel eight hundred forty years, and became the father of sons and daughters 
verse:5:14 and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred ten years, then he died.
verse:5:15 Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Jared. 
verse:5:16 Mahalalel lived after he became the father of Jared eight hundred thirty years, and became the father of sons and daughters. 
verse:5:17 All the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years, then he died.
verse:5:18 Jared lived one hundred sixty-two years, and became the father of Enoch. 
verse:5:19 Jared lived after he became the father of Enoch eight hundred years, and became the father of sons and daughters. 
verse:5:20 All the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years, then he died.
verse:5:21 Enoch lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Methuselah. 
verse:5:22 Enoch walked with God after he became the father of Methuselah three hundred years, and became the father of sons and daughters. 
verse:5:23 All the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years. 
verse:5:24 Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.
verse:5:25 Methuselah lived one hundred eighty-seven years, and became the father of Lamech. 
verse:5:26 Methuselah lived after he became the father of Lamech seven hundred eighty-two years, and became the father of sons and daughters. 
verse:5:27 All the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years, then he died.
verse:5:28 Lamech lived one hundred eighty-two years, and became the father of a son, 
verse:5:29 and he named him Noah, saying, "This same will comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, because of the ground which HASHEM has cursed." 
verse:5:30 Lamech lived after he became the father of Noah five hundred ninety-five years, and became the father of sons and daughters. 
verse:5:31 All the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years, then he died.
verse:5:32 Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
verse:6:1 It happened, when men began to multiply on the surface of the ground, and daughters were born to them, 
verse:6:2 that God's sons saw that men's daughters were beautiful, and they took for themselves wives of all that they chose. 
verse:6:3 HASHEM said, "My Spirit will not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; yet will his days be one hundred twenty years." 
verse:6:4 The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when God's sons came in to men's daughters. They bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.
verse:6:5 HASHEM saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 
verse:6:6 HASHEM was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart. 
verse:6:7 HASHEM said, "I will destroy man whom I have created from the surface of the ground; man, along with animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them." 
verse:6:8 But Noah found favor in HASHEM's eyes.
portion:Genesis 6:9 - 11:32
verse:6:9 This is the history of the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time. Noah walked with God. 
verse:6:10 Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
verse:6:11 The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 
verse:6:12 God saw the earth, and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.
verse:6:13 God said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 
verse:6:14 Make a ship of gopher wood. You shall make rooms in the ship, and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch. 
verse:6:15 This is how you shall make it. The length of the ship will be three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. 
verse:6:16 You shall make a roof in the ship, and you shall finish it to a cubit upward. You shall set the door of the ship in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels. 
verse:6:17 I, even I, do bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky. Everything that is in the earth will die. 
verse:6:18 But I will establish my covenant with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you. 
verse:6:19 Of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female. 
verse:6:20 Of the birds after their kind, of the livestock after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come to you, to keep them alive. 
verse:6:21 Take with you of all food that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it will be for food for you, and for them." 
verse:6:22 Thus Noah did. According to all that God commanded him, so he did.
verse:7:1 HASHEM said to Noah, "Come with all of your household into the ship, for I have seen your righteousness before me in this generation. 
verse:7:2 You shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you, the male and his female. Of the animals that are not clean, take two, the male and his female. 
verse:7:3 Also of the birds of the sky, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth. 
verse:7:4 In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights. Every living thing that I have made, I will destroy from the surface of the ground."
verse:7:5 Noah did everything that HASHEM commanded him.
verse:7:6 Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth. 
verse:7:7 Noah went into the ship with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives, because of the waters of the flood. 
verse:7:8 Clean animals, animals that are not clean, birds, and everything that creeps on the ground 
verse:7:9 went by pairs to Noah into the ship, male and female, as God commanded Noah. 
verse:7:10 It happened after the seven days, that the waters of the flood came on the earth. 
verse:7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep were burst open, and the sky's windows were opened. 
verse:7:12 The rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights.
verse:7:13 In the same day Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ship; 
verse:7:14 they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort. 
verse:7:15 They went to Noah into the ship, by pairs of all flesh with the breath of life in them. 
verse:7:16 Those who went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him; and HASHEM shut him in. 
verse:7:17 The flood was forty days on the earth. The waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth. 
verse:7:18 The waters prevailed, and increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters. 
verse:7:19 The waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth. All the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered. 
verse:7:20 The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered. 
verse:7:21 All flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man. 
verse:7:22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died. 
verse:7:23 Every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were destroyed from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship. 
verse:7:24 The waters prevailed on the earth one hundred fifty days.
verse:8:1 God remembered Noah, all the animals, and all the livestock that were with him in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth. The waters subsided. 
verse:8:2 The deep's fountains and the sky's windows were also stopped, and the rain from the sky was restrained. 
verse:8:3 The waters receded from the earth continually. After the end of one hundred fifty days the waters decreased. 
verse:8:4 The ship rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on Ararat's mountains. 
verse:8:5 The waters receded continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.
verse:8:6 It happened at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made, 
verse:8:7 and he sent out a raven. It went back and forth, until the waters were dried up from the earth. 
verse:8:8 He sent out a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground, 
verse:8:9 but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned to him into the ship; for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth. He put out his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ship. 
verse:8:10 He stayed yet another seven days; and again he sent the dove out of the ship. 
verse:8:11 The dove came back to him at evening, and, behold, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off. So Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth. 
verse:8:12 He stayed yet another seven days, and sent out the dove; and she didn't return to him any more.
verse:8:13 It happened in the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of the ship, and looked. He saw that the surface of the ground was dried. 
verse:8:14 In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
verse:8:15 God spoke to Noah, saying, 
verse:8:16 "Go out of the ship, you, and your wife, and your sons, and your sons' wives with you. 
verse:8:17 Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth."
verse:8:18 Noah went out, with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives with him. 
verse:8:19 Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.
verse:8:20 Noah built an altar to HASHEM, and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 
verse:8:21 HASHEM smelled the pleasant aroma. HASHEM said in his heart, "I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I ever again strike everything living, as I have done. 
verse:8:22 While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."
verse:9:1 God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. 
verse:9:2 The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky. Everything that the ground teems with, and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand. 
verse:9:3 Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. As the green herb, I have given everything to you. 
verse:9:4 But flesh with its life, its blood, you shall not eat. 
verse:9:5 I will surely require your blood of your lives. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, I will require the life of man. 
verse:9:6 Whoever sheds man's blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man in his own image. 
verse:9:7 Be fruitful and multiply. Increase abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it."
verse:9:8 God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying, 
verse:9:9 "As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your offspring after you, 
verse:9:10 and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth. 
verse:9:11 I will establish my covenant with you: all flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood, neither will there ever again be a flood to destroy the earth." 
verse:9:12 God said, "This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 
verse:9:13 I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth. 
verse:9:14 It will happen, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud, 
verse:9:15 and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
verse:9:16 The rainbow will be in the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth." 
verse:9:17 God said to Noah, "This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."
verse:9:18 The sons of Noah who went out from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the father of Canaan. 
verse:9:19 These three were the sons of Noah, and from these, the whole earth was populated.
verse:9:20 Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard. 
verse:9:21 He drank of the wine and got drunk. He was uncovered within his tent. 
verse:9:22 Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside. 
verse:9:23 Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backwards, and they didn't see their father's nakedness. 
verse:9:24 Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to him. 
verse:9:25 He said, "Canaan is cursed. He will be servant of servants to his brothers."
verse:9:26 He said, "Blessed be HASHEM, the God of Shem. Let Canaan be his servant. 
verse:9:27 May God enlarge Japheth. Let him dwell in the tents of Shem. Let Canaan be his servant."
verse:9:28 Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood. 
verse:9:29 All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years, then he died.
verse:10:1 Now this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.
verse:10:2 The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 
verse:10:3 The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 
verse:10:4 The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 
verse:10:5 Of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands, everyone after his language, after their families, in their nations.
verse:10:6 The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. 
verse:10:7 The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan. 
verse:10:8 Cush became the father of Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth. 
verse:10:9 He was a mighty hunter before HASHEM. Therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before HASHEM." 
verse:10:10 The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
verse:10:11 Out of that land he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah, 
verse:10:12 and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city). 
verse:10:13 Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, 
verse:10:14 Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from), and Caphtorim.
verse:10:15 Canaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth, 
verse:10:16 the Jebusite, the Amorite, the Girgashite, 
verse:10:17 the Hivite, the Arkite, the Sinite, 
verse:10:18 the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad. 
verse:10:19 The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you go toward Gerar, to Gaza; as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, to Lasha. 
verse:10:20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their languages, in their lands, in their nations.
verse:10:21 To Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born. 
verse:10:22 The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. 
verse:10:23 The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. 
verse:10:24 Arpachshad became the father of Shelah. Shelah became the father of Eber. 
verse:10:25 To Eber were born two sons. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. His brother's name was Joktan. 
verse:10:26 Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
verse:10:27 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
verse:10:28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
verse:10:29 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan. 
verse:10:30 Their dwelling was from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east. 
verse:10:31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their languages, in their lands, after their nations.
verse:10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations. Of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
verse:11:1 The whole earth was of one language and of one speech. 
verse:11:2 It happened, as they traveled east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there. 
verse:11:3 They said one to another, "Come, let's make bricks, and burn them thoroughly." They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar. 
verse:11:4 They said, "Come, let's build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let's make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth."
verse:11:5 HASHEM came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built. 
verse:11:6 HASHEM said, "Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do. 
verse:11:7 Come, let's go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech." 
verse:11:8 So HASHEM scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city. 
verse:11:9 Therefore its name was called Babel, because there HASHEM confused the language of all the earth. From there, HASHEM scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.
verse:11:10 This is the history of the generations of Shem. Shem was one hundred years old and became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood. 
verse:11:11 Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and became the father of sons and daughters.
verse:11:12 Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah. 
verse:11:13 Arpachshad lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Shelah, and became the father of sons and daughters.
verse:11:14 Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber: 
verse:11:15 and Shelah lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Eber, and became the father of sons and daughters.
verse:11:16 Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg. 
verse:11:17 Eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father of Peleg, and became the father of sons and daughters.
verse:11:18 Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu. 
verse:11:19 Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father of Reu, and became the father of sons and daughters.
verse:11:20 Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug. 
verse:11:21 Reu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father of Serug, and became the father of sons and daughters.
verse:11:22 Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor. 
verse:11:23 Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and became the father of sons and daughters.
verse:11:24 Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah. 
verse:11:25 Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and became the father of sons and daughters.
verse:11:26 Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
verse:11:27 Now this is the history of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the father of Lot. 
verse:11:28 Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur-Kasdim. 
verse:11:29 Abram and Nahor took wives. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran who was also the father of Iscah. 
verse:11:30 Sarai was barren. She had no child. 
verse:11:31 Terah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife. They went from Ur-Kasdim, to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived there. 
verse:11:32 The days of Terah were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran.
portion:Genesis 12:1 - 17:27
verse:12:1 Now HASHEM said to Abram, "Get out of your country, and from your relatives, and from your father's house, to the land that I will show you. 
verse:12:2 I will make of you a great nation. I will bless you and make your name great. You will be a blessing. 
verse:12:3 I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who curses you. All of the families of the earth will be blessed in you."
verse:12:4 So Abram went, as HASHEM had spoken to him. Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran. 
verse:12:5 Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother's son, all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls whom they had gotten in Haran, and they went to go into the land of Canaan. Into the land of Canaan they came. 
verse:12:6 Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. The Canaanite was then in the land.
verse:12:7 HASHEM appeared to Abram and said, "I will give this land to your seed."
He built an altar there to HASHEM, who appeared to him. 
verse:12:8 He left from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to HASHEM and called on the name of HASHEM. 
verse:12:9 Abram traveled, going on still toward the South.
verse:12:10 There was a famine in the land. Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe in the land. 
verse:12:11 It happened, when he had come near to enter Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, "See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at. 
verse:12:12 It will happen, when the Egyptians will see you, that they will say, 'This is his wife.' They will kill me, but they will save you alive. 
verse:12:13 Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you."
verse:12:14 It happened that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. 
verse:12:15 The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. 
verse:12:16 He dealt well with Abram for her sake. He had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels. 
verse:12:17 HASHEM plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife. 
verse:12:18 Pharaoh called Abram and said, "What is this that you have done to me? Why didn't you tell me that she was your wife? 
verse:12:19 Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore, see your wife, take her, and go your way."
verse:12:20 Pharaoh commanded men concerning him, and they brought him on the way with his wife and all that he had.
verse:13:1 Abram went up out of Egypt: he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South. 
verse:13:2 Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. 
verse:13:3 He went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, 
verse:13:4 to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. There Abram called on the name of HASHEM. 
verse:13:5 Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. 
verse:13:6 The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together: for their substance was great, so that they could not live together. 
verse:13:7 There was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time. 
verse:13:8 Abram said to Lot, "Please, let there be no strife between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we are relatives. 
verse:13:9 Isn't the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left."
verse:13:10 Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before HASHEM destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of HASHEM, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar. 
verse:13:11 So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves the one from the other. 
verse:13:12 Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom. 
verse:13:13 Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against HASHEM.
verse:13:14 HASHEM said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, "Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, 
verse:13:15 for all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to your offspring forever. 
verse:13:16 I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then your seed may also be numbered. 
verse:13:17 Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its breadth; for I will give it to you."
verse:13:18 Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to HASHEM.
verse:14:1 It happened in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch, king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim, 
verse:14:2 that they made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha, king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah, and Shemeber, king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar). 
verse:14:3 All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea). 
verse:14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year, they rebelled. 
verse:14:5 In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came, and the kings who were with him, and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 
verse:14:6 and the Horites in their Mount Seir, to Elparan, which is by the wilderness. 
verse:14:7 They returned, and came to En Mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that lived in Hazazon Tamar. 
verse:14:8 The king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in array against them in the valley of Siddim; 
verse:14:9 against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five. 
verse:14:10 Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and those who remained fled to the hills. 
verse:14:11 They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way. 
verse:14:12 They took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
verse:14:13 One who had escaped came and told Abram, the Hebrew. Now he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were allies of Abram. 
verse:14:14 When Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he led out his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan. 
verse:14:15 He divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. 
verse:14:16 He brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative, Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
verse:14:17 The king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley). 
verse:14:18 Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High. 
verse:14:19 He blessed him, and said, "Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth: 
verse:14:20 and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand."
Abram gave him a tenth of all.
verse:14:21 The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people, and take the goods to yourself."
verse:14:22 Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have lifted up my hand to HASHEM, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth, 
verse:14:23 that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours, lest you should say, 'I have made Abram rich.' 
verse:14:24 I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion."
verse:15:1 After these things the word of HASHEM came to Abram in a vision, saying, "Don't be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward."
verse:15:2 Abram said, "My Lord, HASHEM, what will you give me, since I go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?" 
verse:15:3 Abram said, "Behold, to me you have given no seed: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir."
verse:15:4 Behold, the word of HASHEM came to him, saying, "This man will not be your heir, but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir." 
verse:15:5 HASHEM brought him outside, and said, "Look now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to count them." He said to Abram, "So shall your seed be." 
verse:15:6 He believed in HASHEM; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness. 
verse:15:7 He said to him, "I am HASHEM who brought you out of Ur-Kasdim, to give you this land to inherit it."
verse:15:8 He said, "My Lord, HASHEM GOD, how will I know that I will inherit it?"
verse:15:9 He said to him, "Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon." 
verse:15:10 He brought him all of these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he didn't divide the birds. 
verse:15:11 The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.
verse:15:12 When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and great darkness fell on him. 
verse:15:13 He said to Abram, "Know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four hundred years. 
verse:15:14 I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with great wealth, 
verse:15:15 but you will go to your fathers in peace. You will be buried in a good old age. 
verse:15:16 In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full." 
verse:15:17 It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch passed between these pieces. 
verse:15:18 In that day HASHEM made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates: 
verse:15:19 the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 
verse:15:20 the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, 
verse:15:21 the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."
verse:16:1 Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. 
verse:16:2 Sarai said to Abram, "See now, HASHEM has restrained me from bearing. Please go in to my handmaid. It may be that I will obtain children by her." Abram listened to the voice of Sarai. 
verse:16:3 Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife. 
verse:16:4 He went in to Hagar, and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. 
verse:16:5 Sarai said to Abram, "This wrong is your fault. I gave my handmaid into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. HASHEM judge between me and you."
verse:16:6 But Abram said to Sarai, "Behold, your maid is in your hand. Do to her whatever is good in your eyes." Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her face.
verse:16:7 The angel of HASHEM found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. 
verse:16:8 He said, "Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, where did you come from? Where are you going?"
She said, "I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai."
verse:16:9 The angel of HASHEM said to her, "Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hands." 
verse:16:10 The angel of HASHEM said to her, "I will greatly multiply your seed, that they will not be numbered for multitude." 
verse:16:11 The angel of HASHEM said to her, "Behold, you are with child, and will bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because HASHEM has heard your affliction. 
verse:16:12 He will be like a wild donkey among men. His hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him. He will live opposite all of his brothers."
verse:16:13 She called the name of HASHEM who spoke to her, "You are a God who sees," for she said, "Have I even stayed alive after seeing him?" 
verse:16:14 Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi. Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
verse:16:15 Hagar bore a son for Abram. Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. 
verse:16:16 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
verse:17:1 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, HASHEM appeared to Abram, and said to him, "I am God Almighty. Walk before me, and be blameless. 
verse:17:2 I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly."
verse:17:3 Abram fell on his face. God talked with him, saying, 
verse:17:4 "As for me, behold, my covenant is with you. You will be the father of a multitude of nations. 
verse:17:5 Neither will your name any more be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. 
verse:17:6 I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you. Kings will come out of you. 
verse:17:7 I will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your seed after you. 
verse:17:8 I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land where you are traveling, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. I will be their God."
verse:17:9 God said to Abraham, "As for you, you will keep my covenant, you and your seed after you throughout their generations. 
verse:17:10 This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your seed after you. Every male among you shall be circumcised. 
verse:17:11 You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin. It will be a token of the covenant between me and you. 
verse:17:12 He who is eight days old will be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he who is born in the house, or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your seed. 
verse:17:13 He who is born in your house, and he who is bought with your money, must be circumcised. My covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 
verse:17:14 The uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people. He has broken my covenant."
verse:17:15 God said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but her name will be Sarah. 
verse:17:16 I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. Yes, I will bless her, and she will be a mother of nations. Kings of peoples will come from her."
verse:17:17 Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, "Will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old? Will Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?" 
verse:17:18 Abraham said to God, "Oh that Ishmael might live before you!"
verse:17:19 God said, "No, but Sarah, your wife, will bear you a son. You shall call his name Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him. 
verse:17:20 As for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He will become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. 
verse:17:21 But my covenant I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year."
verse:17:22 When he finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham. 
verse:17:23 Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money; every male among the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day, as God had said to him. 
verse:17:24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
verse:17:25 Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
verse:17:26 In the same day both Abraham and Ishmael, his son, were circumcised. 
verse:17:27 All the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
portion:Genesis 18:1 - 22:24
verse:18:1 HASHEM appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day. 
verse:18:2 He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men stood opposite him. When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth, 
verse:18:3 and said, "My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, please don't go away from your servant. 
verse:18:4 Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree. 
verse:18:5 I will get a morsel of bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you may go your way, now that you have come to your servant."
They said, "Very well, do as you have said."
verse:18:6 Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, "Quickly prepare three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes." 
verse:18:7 Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant. He hurried to dress it. 
verse:18:8 He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree, and they ate.
verse:18:9 They asked him, "Where is Sarah, your wife?"
He said, "See, in the tent."
verse:18:10 He said, "I will certainly return to you when the season comes round. Behold, Sarah your wife will have a son."
Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him. 
verse:18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing. 
verse:18:12 Sarah laughed within herself, saying, "After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
verse:18:13 HASHEM said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Will I really bear a child, yet I am old?' 
verse:18:14 Is anything too hard for HASHEM? At the set time I will return to you, when the season comes round, and Sarah will have a son."
verse:18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, "I didn't laugh," for she was afraid.
He said, "No, but you did laugh."
verse:18:16 The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way. 
verse:18:17 HASHEM said, "Will I hide from Abraham what I do, 
verse:18:18 since Abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him? 
verse:18:19 For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of HASHEM, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that HASHEM may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him." 
verse:18:20 HASHEM said, "Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous, 
verse:18:21 I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me. If not, I will know."
verse:18:22 The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before HASHEM. 
verse:18:23 Abraham drew near, and said, "Will you consume the righteous with the wicked? 
verse:18:24 What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it? 
verse:18:25 Be it far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Shouldn't the Judge of all the earth do right?"
verse:18:26 HASHEM said, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake." 
verse:18:27 Abraham answered, "See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to my Lord, who am but dust and ashes. 
verse:18:28 What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?"
He said, "I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there."
verse:18:29 He spoke to him yet again, and said, "What if there are forty found there?"
He said, "I will not do it for the forty's sake."
verse:18:30 He said, "Oh don't let my Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty found there?"
He said, "I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
verse:18:31 He said, "See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to my Lord. What if there are twenty found there?"
He said, "I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake."
verse:18:32 He said, "Oh don't let my Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more. What if ten are found there?"
He said, "I will not destroy it for the ten's sake."
verse:18:33 HASHEM went his way, as soon as he had finished communing with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.
verse:19:1 The two angels came to Sodom at evening. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth, 
verse:19:2 and he said, "See now, my lords, please turn aside into your servant's house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your way."
They said, "No, but we will stay in the street all night."
verse:19:3 He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. 
verse:19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter. 
verse:19:5 They called to Lot, and said to him, "Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them."
verse:19:6 Lot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him. 
verse:19:7 He said, "Please, my brothers, don't act so wickedly. 
verse:19:8 See now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don't do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof."
verse:19:9 They said, "Stand back!" Then they said, "This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now will we deal worse with you, than with them!" They pressed hard on the man Lot, and drew near to break the door. 
verse:19:10 But the men reached out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door. 
verse:19:11 They struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
verse:19:12 The men said to Lot, "Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever you have in the city, bring them out of the place: 
verse:19:13 for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown great before HASHEM that HASHEM has sent us to destroy it."
verse:19:14 Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, "Get up! Get out of this place, for HASHEM will destroy the city."
But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking. 
verse:19:15 When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, "Get up! Take your wife, and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city." 
verse:19:16 But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife's hand, and his two daughters' hands, HASHEM being merciful to him; and they took him out, and set him outside of the city. 
verse:19:17 It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, "Escape for your life! Don't look behind you, and don't stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!"
verse:19:18 Lot said to them, "Oh, not so, my lord. 
verse:19:19 See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can't escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die. 
verse:19:20 See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn't it a little one?), and my soul will live."
verse:19:21 He said to him, "Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. 
verse:19:22 Hurry, escape there, for I can't do anything until you get there." Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
verse:19:23 The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar. 
verse:19:24 Then HASHEM rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from HASHEM out of the sky. 
verse:19:25 He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground. 
verse:19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
verse:19:27 Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before HASHEM. 
verse:19:28 He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and looked, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.
verse:19:29 It happened, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.
verse:19:30 Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters. 
verse:19:31 The firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth. 
verse:19:32 Come, let's make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father's seed." 
verse:19:33 They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He didn't know when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
verse:19:34 It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, "Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine again, tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father's seed." 
verse:19:35 They made their father drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn't know when she lay down, nor when she got up. 
verse:19:36 Thus both of Lot's daughters were with child by their father. 
verse:19:37 The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day. 
verse:19:38 The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi. He is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.
verse:20:1 Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He lived as a foreigner in Gerar. 
verse:20:2 Abraham said about Sarah his wife, "She is my sister." Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. 
verse:20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, "Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken. For she is a man's wife."
verse:20:4 Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, "My Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation? 
verse:20:5 Didn't he tell me, 'She is my sister?' She, even she herself, said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have I done this."
verse:20:6 God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn't allow you to touch her. 
verse:20:7 Now therefore, restore the man's wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you don't restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours."
verse:20:8 Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. The men were very scared. 
verse:20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, "What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!" 
verse:20:10 Abimelech said to Abraham, "What did you see, that you have done this thing?"
verse:20:11 Abraham said, "Because I thought, 'Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife's sake.' 
verse:20:12 Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. 
verse:20:13 It happened, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, 'This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, "He is my brother."'"
verse:20:14 Abimelech took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him. 
verse:20:15 Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you." 
verse:20:16 To Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated."
verse:20:17 Abraham prayed to God. God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his female servants, and they bore children. 
verse:20:18 For HASHEM had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
verse:21:1 HASHEM visited Sarah as he had said, and HASHEM did to Sarah as he had spoken. 
verse:21:2 Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. 
verse:21:3 Abraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac. 
verse:21:4 Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. 
verse:21:5 Abraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac, was born to him. 
verse:21:6 Sarah said, "God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me." 
verse:21:7 She said, "Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in his old age."
verse:21:8 The child grew, and was weaned. Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. 
verse:21:9 Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking. 
verse:21:10 Therefore she said to Abraham, "Cast out this handmaid and her son! For the son of this handmaid will not be heir with my son, Isaac."
verse:21:11 The thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son. 
verse:21:12 God said to Abraham, "Don't let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your handmaid. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For from Isaac will your seed be called. 
verse:21:13 I will also make a nation of the son of the handmaid, because he is your seed." 
verse:21:14 Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child, and sent her away. She departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. 
verse:21:15 The water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. 
verse:21:16 She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, "Don't let me see the death of the child." She sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept. 
verse:21:17 God heard the voice of the boy.
The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, "What ails you, Hagar? Don't be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. 
verse:21:18 Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him in your hand. For I will make him a great nation."
verse:21:19 God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went, filled the bottle with water, and gave the boy drink. 
verse:21:20 God was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer. 
verse:21:21 He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.
verse:21:22 It happened at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, "God is with you in all that you do. 
verse:21:23 Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner."
verse:21:24 Abraham said, "I will swear." 
verse:21:25 Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. 
verse:21:26 Abimelech said, "I don't know who has done this thing. You didn't tell me, neither did I hear of it, until today."
verse:21:27 Abraham took sheep and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant. 
verse:21:28 Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 
verse:21:29 Abimelech said to Abraham, "What do these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves mean?"
verse:21:30 He said, "You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well." 
verse:21:31 Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because they both swore there. 
verse:21:32 So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. 
verse:21:33 Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and called there on the name of HASHEM, the Everlasting God. 
verse:21:34 Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days.
verse:22:1 It happened after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him, "Abraham!"
He said, "Here I am."
verse:22:2 He said, "Now take your son, your only son, whom you love, even Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah. Offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of."
verse:22:3 Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him. 
verse:22:4 On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off. 
verse:22:5 Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go yonder. We will worship, and come back to you." 
verse:22:6 Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. He took in his hand the fire and the knife. They both went together. 
verse:22:7 Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, "My father?"
He said, "Here I am, my son."
He said, "Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
verse:22:8 Abraham said, "God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son." So they both went together. 
verse:22:9 They came to the place which God had told him of. Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood. 
verse:22:10 Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to kill his son.
verse:22:11 The angel of HASHEM called to him out of the sky, and said, "Abraham, Abraham!"
He said, "Here I am."
verse:22:12 He said, "Don't lay your hand on the boy, neither do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me."
verse:22:13 Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son. 
verse:22:14 Abraham called the name of that place HASHEM Will Provide. As it is said to this day, "On HASHEM's mountain, it will be provided."
verse:22:15 The angel of HASHEM called to Abraham a second time out of the sky, 
verse:22:16 and said, "I have sworn by myself, says HASHEM, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son, 
verse:22:17 that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore. Your seed will possess the gate of his enemies. 
verse:22:18 In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice."
verse:22:19 So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. Abraham lived at Beersheba.
verse:22:20 It happened after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, "Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to your brother Nahor: 
verse:22:21 Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, 
verse:22:22 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel." 
verse:22:23 Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother. 
verse:22:24 His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
portion:Genesis 23:1 - 25:18
verse:23:1 Sarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years. This was the length of Sarah's life. 
verse:23:2 Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. 
verse:23:3 Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the children of Heth, saying, 
verse:23:4 "I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
verse:23:5 The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, 
verse:23:6 "Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead."
verse:23:7 Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth. 
verse:23:8 He talked with them, saying, "If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 
verse:23:9 that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a burying-place."
verse:23:10 Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth. Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying, 
verse:23:11 "No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead."
verse:23:12 Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land. 
verse:23:13 He spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, "But if you will, please hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there."
verse:23:14 Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, 
verse:23:15 "My lord, listen to me. What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and you? Therefore bury your dead."
verse:23:16 Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the current merchants' standard.
verse:23:17 So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all of its borders, were deeded 
verse:23:18 to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city. 
verse:23:19 After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan. 
verse:23:20 The field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the children of Heth.
verse:24:1 Abraham was old, and well stricken in age. HASHEM had blessed Abraham in all things. 
verse:24:2 Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, "Please put your hand under my thigh. 
verse:24:3 I will make you swear by HASHEM, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live. 
verse:24:4 But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac."
verse:24:5 The servant said to him, "What if the woman isn't willing to follow me to this land? Must I bring your son again to the land you came from?"
verse:24:6 Abraham said to him, "Beware that you don't bring my son there again. 
verse:24:7 HASHEM, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, 'I will give this land to your seed.' He will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there. 
verse:24:8 If the woman isn't willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this my oath. Only you shall not bring my son there again."
verse:24:9 The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter. 
verse:24:10 The servant took ten camels, of his master's camels, and departed, having a variety of good things of his master's with him. He arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor. 
verse:24:11 He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water. 
verse:24:12 He said, "HASHEM, the God of my master Abraham, please give me success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham. 
verse:24:13 Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water. 
verse:24:14 Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, 'Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,' and she will say, 'Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,'--let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master."
verse:24:15 It happened, before he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder. 
verse:24:16 The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin, neither had any man known her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up. 
verse:24:17 The servant ran to meet her, and said, "Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher."
verse:24:18 She said, "Drink, my lord." She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him drink. 
verse:24:19 When she had done giving him drink, she said, "I will also draw for your camels, until they have done drinking." 
verse:24:20 She hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.
verse:24:21 The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether HASHEM had made his journey prosperous or not. 
verse:24:22 It happened, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold, 
verse:24:23 and said, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father's house for us to lodge in?"
verse:24:24 She said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor." 
verse:24:25 She said moreover to him, "We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in."
verse:24:26 The man bowed his head, and worshiped HASHEM. 
verse:24:27 He said, "Blessed be HASHEM, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, HASHEM has led me in the way to the house of my master's relatives."
verse:24:28 The young lady ran, and told her mother's house about these words. 
verse:24:29 Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man, to the spring. 
verse:24:30 It happened, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, "This is what the man said to me," that he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring. 
verse:24:31 He said, "Come in, you blessed of HASHEM. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels."
verse:24:32 The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. 
verse:24:33 Food was set before him to eat, but he said, "I will not eat until I have told my message."
He said, "Speak on."
verse:24:34 He said, "I am Abraham's servant. 
verse:24:35 HASHEM has blessed my master greatly. He has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys. 
verse:24:36 Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given all that he has to him. 
verse:24:37 My master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, 
verse:24:38 but you shall go to my father's house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.' 
verse:24:39 I asked my master, 'What if the woman will not follow me?' 
verse:24:40 He said to me, 'HASHEM, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son of my relatives, and of my father's house. 
verse:24:41 Then will you be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don't give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.' 
verse:24:42 I came this day to the spring, and said, 'HASHEM, the God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go--
verse:24:43 behold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes out to draw, to whom I will say, "Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink," 
verse:24:44 and she will tell me, "Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,"--let her be the woman whom HASHEM has appointed for my master's son.' 
verse:24:45 Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, 'Please let me drink.' 
verse:24:46 She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, 'Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.' So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink. 
verse:24:47 I asked her, and said, 'Whose daughter are you?' She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.' I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands. 
verse:24:48 I bowed my head, and worshiped HASHEM, and blessed HASHEM, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son. 
verse:24:49 Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."
verse:24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered, "The thing proceeds from HASHEM. We can't speak to you bad or good. 
verse:24:51 Behold, Rebekah is before you. Take her, and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as HASHEM has spoken."
verse:24:52 It happened that when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to HASHEM. 
verse:24:53 The servant brought out jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and her mother. 
verse:24:54 They ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed all night. They rose up in the morning, and he said, "Send me away to my master."
verse:24:55 Her brother and her mother said, "Let the young lady stay with us a few days, at least ten. After that she will go."
verse:24:56 He said to them, "Don't hinder me, since HASHEM has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master."
verse:24:57 They said, "We will call the young lady, and ask her." 
verse:24:58 They called Rebekah, and said to her, "Will you go with this man?"
She said, "I will go."
verse:24:59 They sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse, Abraham's servant, and his men. 
verse:24:60 They blessed Rebekah, and said to her, "Our sister, may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your seed possess the gate of those who hate them."
verse:24:61 Rebekah arose with her ladies. They rode on the camels, and followed the man. The servant took Rebekah, and went his way. 
verse:24:62 Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived in the land of the South. 
verse:24:63 Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening. He lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming. 
verse:24:64 Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel. 
verse:24:65 She said to the servant, "Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us?"
The servant said, "It is my master."
She took her veil, and covered herself. 
verse:24:66 The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. 
verse:24:67 Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. He loved her. Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
verse:25:1 Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah. 
verse:25:2 She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
verse:25:3 Jokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. 
verse:25:4 The sons of Midian: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. 
verse:25:5 Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac, 
verse:25:6 but to the sons of Abraham's concubines, Abraham gave gifts. He sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country. 
verse:25:7 These are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years. 
verse:25:8 Abraham gave up the spirit, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people. 
verse:25:9 Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre, 
verse:25:10 the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his wife. 
verse:25:11 It happened after the death of Abraham that God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi.
verse:25:12 Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham. 
verse:25:13 These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
verse:25:14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
verse:25:15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
verse:25:16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations. 
verse:25:17 These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up the spirit and died, and was gathered to his people. 
verse:25:18 They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives.
portion:Genesis 25:19 - 28:9
verse:25:19 This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham became the father of Isaac. 
verse:25:20 Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife. 
verse:25:21 Isaac entreated HASHEM for his wife, because she was barren. HASHEM was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 
verse:25:22 The children struggled together within her. She said, "If it be so, why do I live?" She went to inquire of HASHEM. 
verse:25:23 HASHEM said to her, "Two nations are in your womb. Two peoples will be separated from your body. The one people will be stronger than the other people. The elder will serve the younger."
verse:25:24 When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 
verse:25:25 The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau. 
verse:25:26 After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.
verse:25:27 The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents. 
verse:25:28 Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob. 
verse:25:29 Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished. 
verse:25:30 Esau said to Jacob, "Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am famished." Therefore his name was called Edom.
verse:25:31 Jacob said, "First, sell me your birthright."
verse:25:32 Esau said, "Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?"
verse:25:33 Jacob said, "Swear to me first."
He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob. 
verse:25:34 Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.
verse:26:1 There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar. 
verse:26:2 HASHEM appeared to him, and said, "Don't go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about. 
verse:26:3 Live in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father. 
verse:26:4 I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and will give to your seed all these lands. In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed, 
verse:26:5 because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
verse:26:6 Isaac lived in Gerar. 
verse:26:7 The men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, "She is my sister," for he was afraid to say, "My wife," lest, he thought, "the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at." 
verse:26:8 It happened, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife. 
verse:26:9 Abimelech called Isaac, and said, "Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, 'She is my sister?'"
Isaac said to him, "Because I said, 'Lest I die because of her.'"
verse:26:10 Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!"
verse:26:11 Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, "He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death."
verse:26:12 Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. HASHEM blessed him. 
verse:26:13 The man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great. 
verse:26:14 He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him. 
verse:26:15 Now all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth. 
verse:26:16 Abimelech said to Isaac, "Go from us, for you are much mightier than we."
verse:26:17 Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.
verse:26:18 Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called their names after the names by which his father had called them. 
verse:26:19 Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. 
verse:26:20 The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, "The water is ours." He called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him. 
verse:26:21 They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. He called its name Sitnah. 
verse:26:22 He left that place, and dug another well. They didn't argue over that one. He called it Rehoboth. He said, "For now HASHEM has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land."
verse:26:23 He went up from there to Beersheba. 
verse:26:24 HASHEM appeared to him the same night, and said, "I am the God of Abraham your father. Don't be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your seed for my servant Abraham's sake."
verse:26:25 He built an altar there, and called on the name of HASHEM, and pitched his tent there. There Isaac's servants dug a well.
verse:26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army. 
verse:26:27 Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
verse:26:28 They said, "We saw plainly that HASHEM was with you. We said, 'Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you, 
verse:26:29 that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.' You are now the blessed of HASHEM."
verse:26:30 He made them a feast, and they ate and drank. 
verse:26:31 They rose up some time in the morning, and swore one to another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 
verse:26:32 It happened the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, "We have found water." 
verse:26:33 He called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.
verse:26:34 When Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite. 
verse:26:35 They grieved Isaac's and Rebekah's spirits.
verse:27:1 It happened, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, "My son?"
He said to him, "Here I am."
verse:27:2 He said, "See now, I am old. I don't know the day of my death. 
verse:27:3 Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison. 
verse:27:4 Make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die."
verse:27:5 Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. 
verse:27:6 Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, "Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying, 
verse:27:7 'Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before HASHEM before my death.' 
verse:27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you. 
verse:27:9 Go now to the flock, and get me from there two good young goats. I will make them savory food for your father, such as he loves. 
verse:27:10 You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death."
verse:27:11 Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. 
verse:27:12 What if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing."
verse:27:13 His mother said to him, "Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them for me."
verse:27:14 He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savory food, such as his father loved. 
verse:27:15 Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son. 
verse:27:16 She put the skins of the young goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck. 
verse:27:17 She gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
verse:27:18 He came to his father, and said, "My father?"
He said, "Here I am. Who are you, my son?"
verse:27:19 Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn. I have done what you asked me to do. Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me."
verse:27:20 Isaac said to his son, "How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?"
He said, "Because HASHEM your God gave me success."
verse:27:21 Isaac said to Jacob, "Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not."
verse:27:22 Jacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau." 
verse:27:23 He didn't recognize him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother, Esau's hands. So he blessed him. 
verse:27:24 He said, "Are you really my son Esau?"
He said, "I am."
verse:27:25 He said, "Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless you."
He brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought him wine, and he drank. 
verse:27:26 His father Isaac said to him, "Come near now, and kiss me, my son." 
verse:27:27 He came near, and kissed him. He smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him, and said, "Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which HASHEM has blessed. 
verse:27:28 God give you of the dew of the sky, of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and new wine. 
verse:27:29 Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers. Let your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you. Blessed be everyone who blesses you."
verse:27:30 It happened, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
verse:27:31 He also made savory food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father, "Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that your soul may bless me."
verse:27:32 Isaac his father said to him, "Who are you?"
He said, "I am your son, your firstborn, Esau."
verse:27:33 Isaac trembled violently, and said, "Who, then, is he who has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? Yes, he will be blessed."
verse:27:34 When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said to his father, "Bless me, even me also, my father."
verse:27:35 He said, "Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing."
verse:27:36 He said, "Isn't he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing." He said, "Haven't you reserved a blessing for me?"
verse:27:37 Isaac answered Esau, "Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants. With grain and new wine have I sustained him. What then will I do for you, my son?"
verse:27:38 Esau said to his father, "Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my father." Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
verse:27:39 Isaac his father answered him, "Behold, of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling, and of the dew of the sky from above. 
verse:27:40 By your sword will you live, and you will serve your brother. It will happen, when you will break loose, that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck."
verse:27:41 Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau said in his heart, "The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob."
verse:27:42 The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, "Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you. 
verse:27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my brother, in Haran. 
verse:27:44 Stay with him a few days, until your brother's fury turns away; 
verse:27:45 until your brother's anger turn away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?"
verse:27:46 Rebekah said to Isaac, "I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?"
verse:28:1 Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, "You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. 
verse:28:2 Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father. Take a wife from there from the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother. 
verse:28:3 May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples, 
verse:28:4 and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your seed with you, that you may inherit the land where you travel, which God gave to Abraham."
verse:28:5 Isaac sent Jacob away. He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, Rebekah's brother, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
verse:28:6 Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram, to take him a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying, "You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan," 
verse:28:7 and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram. 
verse:28:8 Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn't please Isaac, his father. 
verse:28:9 Esau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.
portion:Genesis 28:10 - 32:3
verse:28:10 Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. 
verse:28:11 He came to a certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep. 
verse:28:12 He dreamed. Behold, a stairway set upon the earth, and its top reached to heaven. Behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it. 
verse:28:13 Behold, HASHEM stood above it, and said, "I am HASHEM, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac. The land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed. 
verse:28:14 Your seed will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. In you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed. 
verse:28:15 Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken of to you."
verse:28:16 Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, "Surely HASHEM is in this place, and I didn't know it." 
verse:28:17 He was afraid, and said, "How dreadful is this place! This is none other than God's house, and this is the gate of heaven."
verse:28:18 Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on its top. 
verse:28:19 He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first. 
verse:28:20 Jacob vowed a vow, saying, "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on, 
verse:28:21 so that I come again to my father's house in peace, and HASHEM will be my God, 
verse:28:22 then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be God's house. Of all that you will give me I will surely give the tenth to you."
verse:29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east. 
verse:29:2 He looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, behold, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well's mouth was large. 
verse:29:3 There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well's mouth in its place. 
verse:29:4 Jacob said to them, "My relatives, where are you from?"
They said, "We are from Haran."
verse:29:5 He said to them, "Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?"
They said, "We know him."
verse:29:6 He said to them, "Is it well with him?"
They said, "It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep."
verse:29:7 He said, "Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them."
verse:29:8 They said, "We can't, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth. Then we water the sheep."
verse:29:9 While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she kept them. 
verse:29:10 It happened, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. 
verse:29:11 Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. 
verse:29:12 Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son. She ran and told her father.
verse:29:13 It happened, when Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister's son, that he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things. 
verse:29:14 Laban said to him, "Surely you are my bone and my flesh." He lived with him for a month. 
verse:29:15 Laban said to Jacob, "Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?"
verse:29:16 Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 
verse:29:17 Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive. 
verse:29:18 Jacob loved Rachel. He said, "I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter."
verse:29:19 Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me."
verse:29:20 Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.
verse:29:21 Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her."
verse:29:22 Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. 
verse:29:23 It happened in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. He went in to her. 
verse:29:24 Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid to his daughter Leah for a handmaid. 
verse:29:25 It happened in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. He said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Didn't I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?"
verse:29:26 Laban said, "It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn. 
verse:29:27 Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years."
verse:29:28 Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife. 
verse:29:29 Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her handmaid. 
verse:29:30 He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
verse:29:31 HASHEM saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren. 
verse:29:32 Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said, "Because HASHEM has looked at my affliction. For now my husband will love me." 
verse:29:33 She conceived again, and bore a son, and said, "Because HASHEM has heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also." She named him Simeon. 
verse:29:34 She conceived again, and bore a son. Said, "Now this time will my husband be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons." Therefore was his name called Levi. 
verse:29:35 She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, "This time will I praise HASHEM." Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.
verse:30:1 When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister. She said to Jacob, "Give me children, or else I will die."
verse:30:2 Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, "Am I in God's place, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"
verse:30:3 She said, "Behold, my maid Bilhah. Go in to her, that she may bear on my knees, and I also may obtain children by her." 
verse:30:4 She gave him Bilhah her handmaid as wife, and Jacob went in to her. 
verse:30:5 Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son. 
verse:30:6 Rachel said, "God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son." Therefore called she his name Dan. 
verse:30:7 Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son. 
verse:30:8 Rachel said, "With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed." She named him Naphtali.
verse:30:9 When Leah saw that she had finished bearing, she took Zilpah, her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob as a wife. 
verse:30:10 Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, bore Jacob a son. 
verse:30:11 Leah said, "How fortunate!" She named him Gad. 
verse:30:12 Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, bore Jacob a second son. 
verse:30:13 Leah said, "Happy am I, for the daughters will call me happy." She named him Asher.
verse:30:14 Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."
verse:30:15 She said to her, "Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes, also?"
Rachel said, "Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son's mandrakes."
verse:30:16 Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, "You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son's mandrakes."
He lay with her that night. 
verse:30:17 God listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son. 
verse:30:18 Leah said, "God has given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband." She named him Issachar. 
verse:30:19 Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob. 
verse:30:20 Leah said, "God has endowed me with a good dowry. Now my husband will live with me, because I have borne him six sons." She named him Zebulun. 
verse:30:21 Afterwards, she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.
verse:30:22 God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb. 
verse:30:23 She conceived, bore a son, and said, "God has taken away my reproach." 
verse:30:24 She named him Joseph, saying, "May HASHEM add another son to me."
verse:30:25 It happened, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country. 
verse:30:26 Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you."
verse:30:27 Laban said to him, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, stay here, for I have divined that HASHEM has blessed me for your sake." 
verse:30:28 He said, "Appoint me your wages, and I will give it."
verse:30:29 He said to him, "You know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with me. 
verse:30:30 For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude. HASHEM has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide for my own house also?"
verse:30:31 He said, "What shall I give you?"
Jacob said, "You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it. 
verse:30:32 I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. This will be my hire. 
verse:30:33 So my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my hire that is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be counted stolen."
verse:30:34 Laban said, "Behold, let it be according to your word."
verse:30:35 That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. 
verse:30:36 He set three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
verse:30:37 Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, plane tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. 
verse:30:38 He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink. 
verse:30:39 The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks produced streaked, speckled, and spotted. 
verse:30:40 Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and didn't put them into Laban's flock. 
verse:30:41 It happened, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods; 
verse:30:42 but when the flock were feeble, he didn't put them in. So the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's. 
verse:30:43 The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
verse:31:1 He heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, "Jacob has taken away all that was our father's. From that which was our father's, has he gotten all this wealth." 
verse:31:2 Jacob saw the expression on Laban's face, and, behold, it was not toward him as before. 
verse:31:3 HASHEM said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers, and to your relatives, and I will be with you."
verse:31:4 Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock, 
verse:31:5 and said to them, "I see the expression on your father's face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me. 
verse:31:6 You know that I have served your father with all of my strength. 
verse:31:7 Your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God didn't allow him to hurt me. 
verse:31:8 If he said this, 'The speckled will be your wages,' then all the flock bore speckled. If he said this, 'The streaked will be your wages,' then all the flock bore streaked. 
verse:31:9 Thus God has taken away your father's livestock, and given them to me. 
verse:31:10 It happened during mating season that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled. 
verse:31:11 The angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am.' 
verse:31:12 He said, 'Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you. 
verse:31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.'"
verse:31:14 Rachel and Leah answered him, "Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house? 
verse:31:15 Aren't we accounted by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also quite devoured our money. 
verse:31:16 For all the riches which God has taken away from our father, that is ours and our children's. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do."
verse:31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels, 
verse:31:18 and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan. 
verse:31:19 Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's.
verse:31:20 Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn't tell him that he was running away. 
verse:31:21 So he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.
verse:31:22 Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled. 
verse:31:23 He took his relatives with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey. He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead. 
verse:31:24 God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night, and said to him, "Take heed to yourself that you don't speak to Jacob either good or bad."
verse:31:25 Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead. 
verse:31:26 Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword? 
verse:31:27 Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn't tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp; 
verse:31:28 and didn't allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly. 
verse:31:29 It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Take heed to yourself that you don't speak to Jacob either good or bad.' 
verse:31:30 Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father's house, but why have you stolen my gods?"
verse:31:31 Jacob answered Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I said, 'Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.' 
verse:31:32 Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it." For Jacob didn't know that Rachel had stolen them.
verse:31:33 Laban went into Jacob's tent, into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he didn't find them. He went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. 
verse:31:34 Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel's saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt about all the tent, but didn't find them. 
verse:31:35 She said to her father, "Don't let my lord be angry that I can't rise up before you; for I'm having my period." He searched, but didn't find the teraphim.
verse:31:36 Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, "What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me? 
verse:31:37 Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.
verse:31:38 "These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven't eaten the rams of your flocks. 
verse:31:39 That which was torn of animals, I didn't bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. 
verse:31:40 This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes. 
verse:31:41 These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. 
verse:31:42 Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night."
verse:31:43 Laban answered Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne? 
verse:31:44 Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be for a witness between me and you."
verse:31:45 Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. 
verse:31:46 Jacob said to his relatives, "Gather stones." They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap. 
verse:31:47 Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. 
verse:31:48 Laban said, "This heap is witness between me and you this day." Therefore it was named Galeed 
verse:31:49 and Mizpah, for he said, "HASHEM watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another. 
verse:31:50 If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you." 
verse:31:51 Laban said to Jacob, "See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you. 
verse:31:52 May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm. 
verse:31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac. 
verse:31:54 Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain. 
verse:32:1 Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban departed and returned to his place. 
verse:32:2 Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 
verse:32:3 When he saw them, Jacob said, "This is God's army." He called the name of that place Mahanaim.
portion:Genesis 32:4 - 36:43
verse:32:4 Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom. 
verse:32:5 He commanded them, saying, "This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: 'This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now. 
verse:32:6 I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.'" 
verse:32:7 The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau. Not only that, but he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him." 
verse:32:8 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies; 
verse:32:9 and he said, "If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape." 
verse:32:10 Jacob said, "God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, HASHEM, who said to me, 'Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,' 
verse:32:11 I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies. 
verse:32:12 Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers with the children. 
verse:32:13 You said, 'I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which can't be numbered because there are so many.'"
verse:32:14 He lodged there that night, and took from that which he had with him, a present for Esau, his brother: 
verse:32:15 two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 
verse:32:16 thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals. 
verse:32:17 He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd." 
verse:32:18 He commanded the foremost, saying, "When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, 'Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?' 
verse:32:19 Then you shall say, 'They are your servant, Jacob's. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.'" 
verse:32:20 He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, "This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him. 
verse:32:21 You shall say, 'Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.'" For, he said, "I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me."
verse:32:22 So the present passed over before him, and he himself lodged that night in the camp.
verse:32:23 He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok. 
verse:32:24 He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had. 
verse:32:25 Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day. 
verse:32:26 When he saw that he didn't prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled. 
verse:32:27 The man said, "Let me go, for the day breaks."
Jacob said, "I won't let you go, unless you bless me."
verse:32:28 He said to him, "What is your name?"
He said, "Jacob." 
verse:32:29 He said, "Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed."
verse:32:30 Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name."
He said, "Why is it that you ask what my name is?" He blessed him there.
verse:32:31 Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, he said, "I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved." 
verse:32:32 The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh. 
verse:32:33 Therefore the children of Israel don't eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.
verse:33:1 Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two handmaids. 
verse:33:2 He put the handmaids and their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear. 
verse:33:3 He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
verse:33:4 Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept. 
verse:33:5 He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, "Who are these with you?"
He said, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant." 
verse:33:6 Then the handmaids came near with their children, and they bowed themselves. 
verse:33:7 Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
verse:33:8 Esau said, "What do you mean by all this company which I met?"
Jacob said, "To find favor in the sight of my lord."
verse:33:9 Esau said, "I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours."
verse:33:10 Jacob said, "Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me. 
verse:33:11 Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough." He urged him, and he took it.
verse:33:12 Esau said, "Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you."
verse:33:13 Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die. 
verse:33:14 Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir."
verse:33:15 Esau said, "Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me."
He said, "Why? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord."
verse:33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. 
verse:33:17 Jacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
verse:33:18 Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city. 
verse:33:19 He bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for one hundred pieces of money. 
verse:33:20 He erected an altar there, and called it El Elohe Israel.
verse:34:1 Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. 
verse:34:2 Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her, and humbled her. 
verse:34:3 His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady. 
verse:34:4 Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, "Get me this young lady as a wife."
verse:34:5 Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field. Jacob held his peace until they came. 
verse:34:6 Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him. 
verse:34:7 The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. The men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; a which thing ought not to be done. 
verse:34:8 Hamor talked with them, saying, "The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife. 
verse:34:9 Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves. 
verse:34:10 You shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you. Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it."
verse:34:11 Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, "Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you will tell me I will give. 
verse:34:12 Ask me a great amount for a dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but give me the young lady as a wife."
verse:34:13 The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit, and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister, 
verse:34:14 and said to them, "We can't do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us. 
verse:34:15 Only on this condition will we consent to you. If you will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised; 
verse:34:16 then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. 
verse:34:17 But if you will not listen to us, to be circumcised, then we will take our sister, and we will be gone."
verse:34:18 Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son. 
verse:34:19 The young man didn't wait to do this thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter, and he was honored above all the house of his father. 
verse:34:20 Hamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying, 
verse:34:21 "These men are peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade in it. For behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. 
verse:34:22 Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised. 
verse:34:23 Won't their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let us give our consent to them, and they will dwell with us."
verse:34:24 All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city. 
verse:34:25 It happened on the third day, when they were sore, that two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city, and killed all the males. 
verse:34:26 They killed Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went away. 
verse:34:27 Jacob's sons came on the dead, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister. 
verse:34:28 They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the field, 
verse:34:29 and all their wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their wives, and took as plunder everything that was in the house. 
verse:34:30 Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number. They will gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house."
verse:34:31 They said, "Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute?"
verse:35:1 God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. Make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother."
verse:35:2 Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, "Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, change your garments. 
verse:35:3 Let us arise, and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went."
verse:35:4 They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. 
verse:35:5 They traveled, and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them, and they didn't pursue the sons of Jacob. 
verse:35:6 So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him. 
verse:35:7 He built an altar there, and called the place El Beth El; because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother. 
verse:35:8 Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and its name was called Allon Bacuth.
verse:35:9 God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan Aram, and blessed him. 
verse:35:10 God said to him, "Your name is Jacob. Your name shall not be Jacob any more, but your name will be Israel." He named him Israel. 
verse:35:11 God said to him, "I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations will be from you, and kings will come out of your body. 
verse:35:12 The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, and to your seed after you will I give the land."
verse:35:13 God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him. 
verse:35:14 Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it. 
verse:35:15 Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him "Bethel."
verse:35:16 They traveled from Bethel. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed. She had hard labor. 
verse:35:17 When she was in hard labor, the midwife said to her, "Don't be afraid, for now you will have another son."
verse:35:18 It happened, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she named him Benoni, but his father named him Benjamin. 
verse:35:19 Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem). 
verse:35:20 Jacob set up a pillar on her grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave to this day. 
verse:35:21 Israel traveled, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder. 
verse:35:22 It happened, while Israel lived in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel heard of it.
Now the sons of Jacob were twelve. 
verse:35:23 The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. 
verse:35:24 The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 
verse:35:25 The sons of Bilhah (Rachel's handmaid): Dan and Naphtali. 
verse:35:26 The sons of Zilpah (Leah's handmaid): Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram. 
verse:35:27 Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, to Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac lived as foreigners.
verse:35:28 The days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years. 
verse:35:29 Isaac gave up the spirit, and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. Esau and Jacob, his sons, buried him.
verse:36:1 Now this is the history of the generations of Esau (that is, Edom). 
verse:36:2 Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon, the Hittite; and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, the Hivite; 
verse:36:3 and Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth. 
verse:36:4 Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz. Basemath bore Reuel. 
verse:36:5 Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan. 
verse:36:6 Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his household, with his livestock, all his animals, and all his possessions, which he had gathered in the land of Canaan, and went into a land away from his brother Jacob.

portion:Genesis 37:1 - 40:23
verse:37:1 Jacob lived in the land of his father's travels, in the land of Canaan. 
verse:37:2 This is the history of the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. Joseph brought an evil report of them to their father. 
verse:37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a coat of many colors. 
verse:37:4 His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, and they hated him, and couldn't speak peaceably to him.
verse:37:5 Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him all the more. 
verse:37:6 He said to them, "Please hear this dream which I have dreamed: 
verse:37:7 for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves came around, and bowed down to my sheaf."
verse:37:8 His brothers said to him, "Will you indeed reign over us? Or will you indeed have dominion over us?" They hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words. 
verse:37:9 He dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, "Behold, I have dreamed yet another dream: and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me." 
verse:37:10 He told it to his father and to his brothers. His father rebuked him, and said to him, "What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to you to the earth?" 
verse:37:11 His brothers envied him, but his father kept this saying in mind.
verse:37:12 His brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. 
verse:37:13 Israel said to Joseph, "Aren't your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them." He said to him, "Here I am."
verse:37:14 He said to him, "Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers, and well with the flock; and bring me word again." So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. 
verse:37:15 A certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. The man asked him, "What are you looking for?"
verse:37:16 He said, "I am looking for my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are feeding the flock."
verse:37:17 The man said, "They have left here, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'"
Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan. 
verse:37:18 They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him. 
verse:37:19 They said one to another, "Behold, this dreamer comes. 
verse:37:20 Come now therefore, and let's kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, 'An evil animal has devoured him.' We will see what will become of his dreams."
verse:37:21 Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, "Let's not take his life." 
verse:37:22 Reuben said to them, "Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand on him"--that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father. 
verse:37:23 It happened, when Joseph came to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him; 
verse:37:24 and they took him, and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty. There was no water in it.
verse:37:25 They sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. 
verse:37:26 Judah said to his brothers, "What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? 
verse:37:27 Come, and let's sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not let our hand be on him; for he is our brother, our flesh." His brothers listened to him. 
verse:37:28 Midianites who were merchants passed by, and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. They brought Joseph into Egypt.
verse:37:29 Reuben returned to the pit; and saw that Joseph wasn't in the pit; and he tore his clothes. 
verse:37:30 He returned to his brothers, and said, "The child is no more; and I, where will I go?" 
verse:37:31 They took Joseph's coat, and killed a male goat, and dipped the coat in the blood. 
verse:37:32 They took the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, "We have found this. Examine it, now, whether it is your son's coat or not."
verse:37:33 He recognized it, and said, "It is my son's coat. An evil animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces." 
verse:37:34 Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days. 
verse:37:35 All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He said, "For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning." His father wept for him. 
verse:37:36 The Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.
verse:38:1 It happened at that time, that Judah went down from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 
verse:38:2 Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. He took her, and went in to her. 
verse:38:3 She conceived, and bore a son; and he named him Er. 
verse:38:4 She conceived again, and bore a son; and she named him Onan. 
verse:38:5 She yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him. 
verse:38:6 Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. 
verse:38:7 Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of HASHEM. HASHEM killed him. 
verse:38:8 Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her, and raise up seed to your brother." 
verse:38:9 Onan knew that the seed wouldn't be his; and it happened, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother. 
verse:38:10 The thing which he did was evil in the sight of HASHEM, and he killed him also. 
verse:38:11 Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow in your father's house, until Shelah, my son, is grown up;" for he said, "Lest he also die, like his brothers." Tamar went and lived in her father's house.
verse:38:12 After many days, Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite. 
verse:38:13 It was told Tamar, saying, "Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep." 
verse:38:14 She took off of her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn't given to him as a wife. 
verse:38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. 
verse:38:16 He turned to her by the way, and said, "Please come, let me come in to you," for he didn't know that she was his daughter-in-law.
She said, "What will you give me, that you may come in to me?"
verse:38:17 He said, "I will send you a young goat from the flock."
She said, "Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?"
verse:38:18 He said, "What pledge will I give you?"
She said, "Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand."
He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him. 
verse:38:19 She arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. 
verse:38:20 Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand, but he didn't find her. 
verse:38:21 Then he asked the men of her place, saying, "Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the road?"
They said, "There has been no prostitute here."
verse:38:22 He returned to Judah, and said, "I haven't found her; and also the men of the place said, 'There has been no prostitute here.'" 
verse:38:23 Judah said, "Let her keep it, lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this young goat, and you haven't found her."
verse:38:24 It happened about three months later, that it was told Judah, saying, "Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has played the prostitute; and moreover, behold, she is with child by prostitution."
Judah said, "Bring her out, and let her be burnt." 
verse:38:25 When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, "By the man, whose these are, I am with child." She also said, "Please discern whose are these--the signet, and the cords, and the staff."
verse:38:26 Judah acknowledged them, and said, "She is more righteous than I, because I didn't give her to Shelah, my son."
He knew her again no more. 
verse:38:27 It happened in the time of her travail, that behold, twins were in her womb. 
verse:38:28 When she travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, "This came out first." 
verse:38:29 It happened, as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out, and she said, "Why have you made a breach for yourself?" Therefore his name was called Perez. 
verse:38:30 Afterward his brother came out, that had the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.
verse:39:1 Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there. 
verse:39:2 HASHEM was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 
verse:39:3 His master saw that HASHEM was with him, and that HASHEM made all that he did prosper in his hand. 
verse:39:4 Joseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. 
verse:39:5 It happened from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that HASHEM blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of HASHEM was on all that he had, in the house and in the field. 
verse:39:6 He left all that he had in Joseph's hand. He didn't concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate.
Joseph was well-built and handsome. 
verse:39:7 It happened after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph; and she said, "Lie with me."
verse:39:8 But he refused, and said to his master's wife, "Behold, my master doesn't know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand. 
verse:39:9 He isn't greater in this house than I, neither has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
verse:39:10 As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he didn't listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her. 
verse:39:11 About this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside. 
verse:39:12 She caught him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me!"
He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside. 
verse:39:13 When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside, 
verse:39:14 she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, "Behold, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice. 
verse:39:15 It happened, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and ran outside." 
verse:39:16 She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home. 
verse:39:17 She spoke to him according to these words, saying, "The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me, 
verse:39:18 and it happened, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and ran outside."
verse:39:19 It happened, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, "This is what your servant did to me," that his wrath was kindled. 
verse:39:20 Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody. 
verse:39:21 But HASHEM was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. 
verse:39:22 The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it. 
verse:39:23 The keeper of the prison didn't look after anything that was under his hand, because HASHEM was with him; and that which he did, HASHEM made it prosper.
verse:40:1 It happened after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord, the king of Egypt. 
verse:40:2 Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. 
verse:40:3 He put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. 
verse:40:4 The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he took care of them. They stayed in prison many days. 
verse:40:5 They both dreamed a dream, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison. 
verse:40:6 Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad. 
verse:40:7 He asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody in his master's house, saying, "Why do you look so sad today?"
verse:40:8 They said to him, "We have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it."
Joseph said to them, "Don't interpretations belong to God? Please tell it to me."
verse:40:9 The chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, "In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me, 
verse:40:10 and in the vine were three branches. It was as though it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters produced ripe grapes. 
verse:40:11 Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
verse:40:12 Joseph said to him, "This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days. 
verse:40:13 Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, and restore you to your office. You will give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, the way you did when you were his cupbearer. 
verse:40:14 But remember me when it will be well with you, and please show kindness to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house. 
verse:40:15 For indeed, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon."
verse:40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, "I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head. 
verse:40:17 In the uppermost basket there was all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head."
verse:40:18 Joseph answered, "This is its interpretation. The three baskets are three days. 
verse:40:19 Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you, and will hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you." 
verse:40:20 It happened the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants. 
verse:40:21 He restored the chief cupbearer to his position again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand; 
verse:40:22 but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them. 
verse:40:23 Yet the chief cupbearer didn't remember Joseph, but forgot him.
portion:Genesis 41:1 - 44:17
verse:41:1 It happened at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and behold, he stood by the river. 
verse:41:2 Behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, sleek and fat, and they fed in the marsh grass. 
verse:41:3 Behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river, ugly and thin, and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river. 
verse:41:4 The ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke. 
verse:41:5 He slept and dreamed a second time: and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and good. 
verse:41:6 Behold, seven heads of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. 
verse:41:7 The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. 
verse:41:8 It happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all of Egypt's magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
verse:41:9 Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, "I remember my faults today. 
verse:41:10 Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker. 
verse:41:11 We dreamed a dream in one night, I and he. We dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. 
verse:41:12 There was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. To each man according to his dream he interpreted. 
verse:41:13 It happened, as he interpreted to us, so it was: he restored me to my office, and he hanged him."
verse:41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. He shaved himself, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh. 
verse:41:15 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."
verse:41:16 Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, "It isn't in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace."
verse:41:17 Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, "In my dream, behold, I stood on the brink of the river: 
verse:41:18 and behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, fat and sleek. They fed in the marsh grass, 
verse:41:19 and behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness. 
verse:41:20 The thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle, 
verse:41:21 and when they had eaten them up, it couldn't be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke. 
verse:41:22 I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good: 
verse:41:23 and behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. 
verse:41:24 The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me."
verse:41:25 Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh. 
verse:41:26 The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads of grain are seven years. The dream is one. 
verse:41:27 The seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine. 
verse:41:28 That is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh. What God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh. 
verse:41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt. 
verse:41:30 There will arise after them seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land, 
verse:41:31 and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous. 
verse:41:32 The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
verse:41:33 "Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt. 
verse:41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt's produce in the seven plenteous years. 
verse:41:35 Let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. 
verse:41:36 The food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; that the land not perish through the famine."
verse:41:37 The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. 
verse:41:38 Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?" 
verse:41:39 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Because God has shown you all of this, there is none so discreet and wise as you. 
verse:41:40 You shall be over my house, and according to your word will all my people be ruled. Only in the throne I will be greater than you." 
verse:41:41 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt." 
verse:41:42 Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck, 
verse:41:43 and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had. They cried before him, "Bow the knee!" He set him over all the land of Egypt. 
verse:41:44 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, and without you shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt." 
verse:41:45 Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-Paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife. Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
verse:41:46 Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. 
verse:41:47 In the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly. 
verse:41:48 He gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was around every city, he laid up in the same. 
verse:41:49 Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped counting, for it was without number. 
verse:41:50 To Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him. 
verse:41:51 Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, "For," he said, "God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house." 
verse:41:52 The name of the second, he called Ephraim: "For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."
verse:41:53 The seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt, came to an end. 
verse:41:54 The seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 
verse:41:55 When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do." 
verse:41:56 The famine was over all the surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt. 
verse:41:57 All countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.
verse:42:1 Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, "Why do you look at one another?" 
verse:42:2 He said, "Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die." 
verse:42:3 Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. 
verse:42:4 But Jacob didn't send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers; for he said, "Lest perhaps harm happen to him." 
verse:42:5 The sons of Israel came to buy among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan. 
verse:42:6 Joseph was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. Joseph's brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth. 
verse:42:7 Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them. He said to them, "Where did you come from?"
They said, "From the land of Canaan to buy food."
verse:42:8 Joseph recognized his brothers, but they didn't recognize him. 
verse:42:9 Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them, and said to them, "You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land."
verse:42:10 They said to him, "No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. 
verse:42:11 We are all one man's sons; we are honest men. Your servants are not spies."
verse:42:12 He said to them, "No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land!"
verse:42:13 They said, "We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more."
verse:42:14 Joseph said to them, "It is like I told you, saying, 'You are spies!' 
verse:42:15 By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go out from here, unless your youngest brother comes here. 
verse:42:16 Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies." 
verse:42:17 He put them all together into custody for three days.
verse:42:18 Joseph said to them the third day, "Do this, and live, for I fear God. 
verse:42:19 If you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses. 
verse:42:20 Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you won't die."
They did so. 
verse:42:21 They said one to another, "We are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn't listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us." 
verse:42:22 Reuben answered them, saying, "Didn't I tell you, saying, 'Don't sin against the child,' and you wouldn't listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required." 
verse:42:23 They didn't know that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them. 
verse:42:24 He turned himself away from them, and wept. Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes. 
verse:42:25 Then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore each man's money into his sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them.
verse:42:26 They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there. 
verse:42:27 As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack. 
verse:42:28 He said to his brothers, "My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!" Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, "What is this that God has done to us?" 
verse:42:29 They came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying, 
verse:42:30 "The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country. 
verse:42:31 We said to him, 'We are honest men. We are no spies. 
verse:42:32 We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.' 
verse:42:33 The man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way. 
verse:42:34 Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.'"
verse:42:35 It happened as they emptied their sacks, that behold, each man's bundle of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. 
verse:42:36 Jacob, their father, said to them, "You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these things are against me."
verse:42:37 Reuben spoke to his father, saying, "Kill my two sons, if I don't bring him to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again."
verse:42:38 He said, "My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol."
verse:43:1 The famine was severe in the land. 
verse:43:2 It happened, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, "Go again, buy us a little more food."
verse:43:3 Judah spoke to him, saying, "The man solemnly warned us, saying, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.' 
verse:43:4 If you'll send our brother with us, we'll go down and buy you food, 
verse:43:5 but if you'll not send him, we'll not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.'"
verse:43:6 Israel said, "Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another brother?"
verse:43:7 They said, "The man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?' We just answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down?'"
verse:43:8 Judah said to Israel, his father, "Send the boy with me, and we'll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones. 
verse:43:9 I'll be collateral for him. From my hand will you require him. If I don't bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever, 
verse:43:10 for if we hadn't delayed, surely we would have returned a second time by now."
verse:43:11 Their father, Israel, said to them, "If it must be so, then do this. Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds; 
verse:43:12 and take double money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight. 
verse:43:13 Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man. 
verse:43:14 May God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
verse:43:15 The men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. 
verse:43:16 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, "Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal, and prepare; for the men will dine with me at noon."
verse:43:17 The man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph's house. 
verse:43:18 The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, "Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, we're brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our donkeys." 
verse:43:19 They came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house, 
verse:43:20 and said, "Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food. 
verse:43:21 When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and behold, each man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our hand. 
verse:43:22 We have brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We don't know who put our money in our sacks."
verse:43:23 He said, "Peace be to you. Don't be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money." He brought Simeon out to them. 
verse:43:24 The man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder. 
verse:43:25 They prepared the present for Joseph's coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.
verse:43:26 When Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to him to the earth. 
verse:43:27 He asked them of their welfare, and said, "Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?"
verse:43:28 They said, "Your servant, our father, is well. He is still alive." They bowed down humbly. 
verse:43:29 He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother's son, and said, "Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?" He said, "God be gracious to you, my son." 
verse:43:30 Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep. He entered into his room, and wept there. 
verse:43:31 He washed his face, and came out. He controlled himself, and said, "Serve the meal."
verse:43:32 They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians, that ate with him, by themselves, because the Egyptians don't eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians. 
verse:43:33 They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth, and the men marveled one with another. 
verse:43:34 He sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. They drank, and were merry with him.
verse:44:1 He commanded the steward of his house, saying, "Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in his sack's mouth. 
verse:44:2 Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, with his grain money." He did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. 
verse:44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. 
verse:44:4 When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, "Up, follow after the men. When you overtake them, ask them, 'Why have you rewarded evil for good? 
verse:44:5 Isn't this that from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You have done evil in so doing.'" 
verse:44:6 He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them.
verse:44:7 They said to him, "Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing! 
verse:44:8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan. How then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord's house? 
verse:44:9 With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondservants."
verse:44:10 He said, "Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found will be my bondservant; and you will be blameless."
verse:44:11 Then they hurried, and each man took his sack down to the ground, and each man opened his sack. 
verse:44:12 He searched, beginning with the eldest, and ending at the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin's sack. 
verse:44:13 Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city.
verse:44:14 Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, and he was still there. They fell on the ground before him. 
verse:44:15 Joseph said to them, "What deed is this that you have done? Don't you know that such a man as I can indeed divine?"
verse:44:16 Judah said, "What will we tell my lord? What will we speak? Or how will we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we are my lord's bondservants, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found."
verse:44:17 He said, "Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my bondservant; but as for you, go up in peace to your father."
portion:Genesis 44:18 - 47:27
verse:44:18 Then Judah came near to him, and said, "Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears, and don't let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh. 
verse:44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father, or a brother?' 
verse:44:20 We said to my lord, 'We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him.' 
verse:44:21 You said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.' 
verse:44:22 We said to my lord, 'The boy can't leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.' 
verse:44:23 You said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will see my face no more.' 
verse:44:24 It happened when we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. 
verse:44:25 Our father said, 'Go again, buy us a little food.' 
verse:44:26 We said, 'We can't go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down: for we may not see the man's face, unless our youngest brother is with us.' 
verse:44:27 Your servant, my father, said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons: 
verse:44:28 and the one went out from me, and I said, "Surely he is torn in pieces;" and I haven't seen him since. 
verse:44:29 If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.' 
verse:44:30 Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us; since his life is bound up in the boy's life; 
verse:44:31 it will happen, when he sees that the boy is no more, that he will die. Your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant, our father, with sorrow to Sheol. 
verse:44:32 For your servant became collateral for the boy to my father, saying, 'If I don't bring him to you, then I will bear the blame to my father forever.' 
verse:44:33 Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the boy, a bondservant to my lord; and let the boy go up with his brothers. 
verse:44:34 For how will I go up to my father, if the boy isn't with me?--lest I see the evil that will come on my father."
verse:45:1 Then Joseph couldn't control himself before all those who stood before him, and he cried, "Cause everyone to go out from me!" No one else stood with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brothers. 
verse:45:2 He wept aloud. The Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard. 
verse:45:3 Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Does my father still live?"
His brothers couldn't answer him; for they were terrified at his presence. 
verse:45:4 Joseph said to his brothers, "Come near to me, please."
They came near. "He said, I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. 
verse:45:5 Now don't be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life. 
verse:45:6 For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest. 
verse:45:7 God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance. 
verse:45:8 So now it wasn't you who sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt. 
verse:45:9 Hurry, and go up to my father, and tell him, 'This is what your son Joseph says, "God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me. Don't wait. 
verse:45:10 You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be near to me, you, your children, your children's children, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have. 
verse:45:11 There I will nourish you; for there are yet five years of famine; lest you come to poverty, you, and your household, and all that you have."' 
verse:45:12 Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you. 
verse:45:13 You shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. You shall hurry and bring my father down here." 
verse:45:14 He fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck. 
verse:45:15 He kissed all his brothers, and wept on them. After that his brothers talked with him.
verse:45:16 The report of it was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, "Joseph's brothers have come." It pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. 
verse:45:17 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers, 'Do this. Load your animals, and go, travel to the land of Canaan. 
verse:45:18 Take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.' 
verse:45:19 Now you are commanded: do this. Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. 
verse:45:20 Also, don't concern yourselves about your belongings, for the good of all of the land of Egypt is yours."
verse:45:21 The sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. 
verse:45:22 He gave each one of them changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing. 
verse:45:23 He sent the following to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way. 
verse:45:24 So he sent his brothers away, and they departed. He said to them, "See that you don't quarrel on the way."
verse:45:25 They went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father. 
verse:45:26 They told him, saying, "Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt." His heart fainted, for he didn't believe them. 
verse:45:27 They told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them. When he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived. 
verse:45:28 Israel said, "It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."
verse:46:1 Israel traveled with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father, Isaac. 
verse:46:2 God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, "Jacob, Jacob!"
He said, "Here I am."
verse:46:3 He said, "I am God, the God of your father. Don't be afraid to go down into Egypt, for there I will make of you a great nation. 
verse:46:4 I will go down with you into Egypt. I will also surely bring you up again. Joseph will close your eyes."
verse:46:5 Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob, their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 
verse:46:6 They took their livestock, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt--Jacob, and all his seed with him, 
verse:46:7 his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and he brought all his seed with him into Egypt.
verse:46:8 These are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. 
verse:46:9 The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 
verse:46:10 The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. 
verse:46:11 The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
verse:46:12 The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. 
verse:46:13 The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron. 
verse:46:14 The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. 
verse:46:15 These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, with his daughter Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three. 
verse:46:16 The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. 
verse:46:17 The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah their sister. The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel. 
verse:46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah, his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls. 
verse:46:19 The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin. 
verse:46:20 To Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him. 
verse:46:21 The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. 
verse:46:22 These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen. 
verse:46:23 The son of Dan: Hushim. 
verse:46:24 The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 
verse:46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob: all the souls were seven. 
verse:46:26 All the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt, who were his direct descendants, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were sixty-six. 
verse:46:27 The sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, were seventy.
verse:46:28 He sent Judah before him to Joseph, to show the way before him to Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen. 
verse:46:29 Joseph prepared his chariot, and went up to meet Israel, his father, in Goshen. He presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. 
verse:46:30 Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive."
verse:46:31 Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father's house, "I will go up, and speak with Pharaoh, and will tell him, 'My brothers, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me. 
verse:46:32 These men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock, and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.' 
verse:46:33 It will happen, when Pharaoh summons you, and will say, 'What is your occupation?' 
verse:46:34 that you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers:' that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians."
verse:47:1 Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, "My father and my brothers, with their flocks, their herds, and all that they own, have come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen." 
verse:47:2 From among his brothers he took five men, and presented them to Pharaoh. 
verse:47:3 Pharaoh said to his brothers, "What is your occupation?"
They said to Pharaoh, "Your servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers." 
verse:47:4 They said to Pharaoh, "We have come to live as foreigners in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks. For the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen."
verse:47:5 Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, "Your father and your brothers have come to you. 
verse:47:6 The land of Egypt is before you. Make your father and your brothers dwell in the best of the land. Let them dwell in the land of Goshen. If you know any able men among them, then put them in charge of my livestock."
verse:47:7 Joseph brought in Jacob, his father, and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
verse:47:8 Pharaoh said to Jacob, "How many are the days of the years of your life?"
verse:47:9 Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage." 
verse:47:10 Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
verse:47:11 Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 
verse:47:12 Joseph nourished his father, his brothers, and all of his father's household, with bread, according to their families.
verse:47:13 There was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. 
verse:47:14 Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. 
verse:47:15 When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, "Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For our money fails."
verse:47:16 Joseph said, "Give me your livestock; and I will give you food for your livestock, if your money is gone."
verse:47:17 They brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year. 
verse:47:18 When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, "We will not hide from my lord how our money is all spent, and the herds of livestock are my lord's. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands. 
verse:47:19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land won't be desolate."
verse:47:20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every man of the Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe on them, and the land became Pharaoh's. 
verse:47:21 As for the people, he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it. 
verse:47:22 Only he didn't buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they didn't sell their land. 
verse:47:23 Then Joseph said to the people, "Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land. 
verse:47:24 It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for food for your little ones."
verse:47:25 They said, "You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."
verse:47:26 Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone didn't become Pharaoh's. 
verse:47:27 Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got themselves possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.
portion:Genesis 47:28 - 50:26
verse:47:28 Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years. 
verse:47:29 The time drew near that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, "If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please don't bury me in Egypt, 
verse:47:30 but when I sleep with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place."
He said, "I will do as you have said."
verse:47:31 He said, "Swear to me," and he swore to him. Israel bowed himself on the bed's head.
verse:48:1 It happened after these things, that someone said to Joseph, "Behold, your father is sick." He took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 
verse:48:2 Someone told Jacob, and said, "Behold, your son Joseph comes to you," and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed. 
verse:48:3 Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 
verse:48:4 and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession.' 
verse:48:5 Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine. 
verse:48:6 Your issue, whom you become the father of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance. 
verse:48:7 As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem)."
verse:48:8 Israel saw Joseph's sons, and said, "Who are these?"
verse:48:9 Joseph said to his father, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here."
He said, "Please bring them to me, and I will bless them." 
verse:48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn't see. He brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. 
verse:48:11 Israel said to Joseph, "I didn't think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your seed also." 
verse:48:12 Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. 
verse:48:13 Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him. 
verse:48:14 Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn. 
verse:48:15 He blessed Joseph, and said, "The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day, 
verse:48:16 the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads, and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. Let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
verse:48:17 When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head. 
verse:48:18 Joseph said to his father, "Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head."
verse:48:19 His father refused, and said, "I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his seed will become a multitude of nations." 
verse:48:20 He blessed them that day, saying, "In you will Israel bless, saying, 'God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh'" He set Ephraim before Manasseh. 
verse:48:21 Israel said to Joseph, "Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers. 
verse:48:22 Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."
verse:49:1 Jacob called to his sons, and said: "Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come. 
verse:49:2 Assemble yourselves, and hear, you sons of Jacob. Listen to Israel, your father.
verse:49:3 "Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength; excelling in dignity, and excelling in power. 
verse:49:4 Boiling over as water, you shall not excel; because you went up to your father's bed, then defiled it. He went up to my couch.
verse:49:5 "Simeon and Levi are brothers. Their swords are weapons of violence. 
verse:49:6 My soul, don't come into their council. My glory, don't be united to their assembly; for in their anger they killed men. In their self-will they hamstrung cattle. 
verse:49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel. I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
verse:49:8 "Judah, your brothers will praise you. Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies. Your father's sons will bow down before you. 
verse:49:9 Judah is a lion's cub. From the prey, my son, you have gone up. He stooped down, he crouched as a lion, as a lioness. Who will rouse him up? 
verse:49:10 The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until he comes to whom it belongs. To him will the obedience of the peoples be. 
verse:49:11 Binding his foal to the vine, his donkey's colt to the choice vine; he has washed his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes. 
verse:49:12 His eyes will be red with wine, his teeth white with milk.
verse:49:13 "Zebulun will dwell at the haven of the sea. He will be for a haven of ships. His border will be on Sidon.
verse:49:14 "Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between the saddlebags. 
verse:49:15 He saw a resting place, that it was good, the land, that it was pleasant. He bows his shoulder to the burden, and becomes a servant doing forced labor.
verse:49:16 "Dan will judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. 
verse:49:17 Dan will be a serpent in the way, an adder in the path, That bites the horse's heels, so that his rider falls backward. 
verse:49:18 I have waited for your salvation, HASHEM.
verse:49:19 "A troop will press on Gad, but he will press on their heel.
verse:49:20 "Asher's food will be rich. He will yield royal dainties.
verse:49:21 "Naphtali is a doe set free, who bears beautiful fawns.
verse:49:22 "Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a spring. His branches run over the wall. 
verse:49:23 The archers have severely grieved him, shot at him, and persecute him: 
verse:49:24 But his bow remained strong. The arms of his hands were made strong, by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, (from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel), 
verse:49:25 even by the God of your father, who will help you; by the Almighty, who will bless you, with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lies below, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb. 
verse:49:26 The blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of your ancestors, above the boundaries of the ancient hills. They will be on the head of Joseph, on the crown of the head of him who is separated from his brothers.
verse:49:27 "Benjamin is a ravenous wolf. In the morning he will devour the prey. At evening he will divide the spoil."
verse:49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke to them and blessed them. He blessed everyone according to his blessing. 
verse:49:29 He instructed them, and said to them, "I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
verse:49:30 in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place. 
verse:49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah, his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah, his wife, and there I buried Leah: 
verse:49:32 the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth." 
verse:49:33 When Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the spirit, and was gathered to his people.
verse:50:1 Joseph fell on his father's face, wept on him, and kissed him. 
verse:50:2 Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Israel. 
verse:50:3 Forty days were fulfilled for him, for that is how many the days it takes to embalm. The Egyptians wept for him for seventy days.
verse:50:4 When the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 
verse:50:5 'My father made me swear, saying, "Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan." Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come again.'"
verse:50:6 Pharaoh said, "Go up, and bury your father, just like he made you swear."
verse:50:7 Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt, 
verse:50:8 all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father's house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. 
verse:50:9 There went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company. 
verse:50:10 They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation. He mourned for his father seven days. 
verse:50:11 When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, "This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians." Therefore, its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan. 
verse:50:12 His sons did to him just as he commanded them, 
verse:50:13 for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burial site, from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre. 
verse:50:14 Joseph returned into Egypt--he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
verse:50:15 When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all of the evil which we did to him." 
verse:50:16 They sent a message to Joseph, saying, "Your father commanded before he died, saying, 
verse:50:17 'You shall tell Joseph, "Now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers, and their sin, because they did evil to you."' Now, please forgive the disobedience of the servants of the God of your father." Joseph wept when they spoke to him. 
verse:50:18 His brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, "Behold, we are your servants." 
verse:50:19 Joseph said to them, "Don't be afraid, for am I in the place of God? 
verse:50:20 As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive. 
verse:50:21 Now therefore don't be afraid. I will nourish you and your little ones." He comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.
verse:50:22 Joseph lived in Egypt, he, and his father's house. Joseph lived one hundred ten years. 
verse:50:23 Joseph saw Ephraim's children to the third generation. The children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on Joseph's knees. 
verse:50:24 Joseph said to his brothers, "I am dying, but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob." 
verse:50:25 Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here." 
verse:50:26 So Joseph died, being one hundred ten years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
portion:Exodus 1:1 - 6:1
verse:1:1 Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob): 
verse:1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 
verse:1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 
verse:1:4 Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. 
verse:1:5 All the souls who came out of Jacob's body were seventy souls, and Joseph was in Egypt already. 
verse:1:6 Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation. 
verse:1:7 The children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.
verse:1:8 Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who didn't know Joseph. 
verse:1:9 He said to his people, "Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we. 
verse:1:10 Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and escape out of the land." 
verse:1:11 Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses. 
verse:1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They were grieved because of the children of Israel. 
verse:1:13 The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve, 
verse:1:14 and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all kinds of service in the field, all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve.
verse:1:15 The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah, 
verse:1:16 and he said, "When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birth stool; if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live." 
verse:1:17 But the midwives feared God, and didn't do what the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the baby boys alive. 
verse:1:18 The king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, "Why have you done this thing, and have saved the boys alive?"
verse:1:19 The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women aren't like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous, and give birth before the midwife comes to them."
verse:1:20 God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty. 
verse:1:21 It happened, because the midwives feared God, that he gave them families. 
verse:1:22 Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, "You shall cast every son who is born into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive."
verse:2:1 A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as his wife. 
verse:2:2 The woman conceived, and bore a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months. 
verse:2:3 When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and coated it with tar and with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river's bank. 
verse:2:4 His sister stood far off, to see what would be done to him. 
verse:2:5 Pharaoh's daughter came down to bathe at the river. Her maidens walked along by the riverside. She saw the basket among the reeds, and sent her handmaid to get it. 
verse:2:6 She opened it, and saw the child, and behold, the baby cried. She had compassion on him, and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children."
verse:2:7 Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?"
verse:2:8 Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go."
The maiden went and called the child's mother. 
verse:2:9 Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages."
The woman took the child, and nursed it. 
verse:2:10 The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, and said, "Because I drew him out of the water."
verse:2:11 It happened in those days, when Moses had grown up, that he went out to his brothers, and looked at their burdens. He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers. 
verse:2:12 He looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one, he killed the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
verse:2:13 He went out the second day, and behold, two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other. He said to him who did the wrong, "Why do you strike your fellow?"
verse:2:14 He said, "Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?"
Moses was afraid, and said, "Surely this thing is known." 
verse:2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.
verse:2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. 
verse:2:17 The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 
verse:2:18 When they came to Reuel, their father, he said, "How is it that you have returned so early today?"
verse:2:19 They said, "An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock."
verse:2:20 He said to his daughters, "Where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread."
verse:2:21 Moses was content to dwell with the man. He gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter. 
verse:2:22 She bore a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, "I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land."
verse:2:23 It happened in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage. 
verse:2:24 God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 
verse:2:25 God saw the children of Israel, and God was concerned about them.
verse:3:1 Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to God's mountain, to Horeb. 
verse:3:2 The angel of HASHEM appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. 
verse:3:3 Moses said, "I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt."
verse:3:4 When HASHEM saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said, "Moses! Moses!"
He said, "Here I am."
verse:3:5 He said, "Don't come close. Take your sandals off of your feet, for the place you are standing on is holy ground." 
verse:3:6 Moreover he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."
Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look at God.
verse:3:7 HASHEM said, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows. 
verse:3:8 I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
verse:3:9 Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. 
verse:3:10 Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt."
verse:3:11 Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?"
verse:3:12 He said, "Certainly I will be with you. This will be the token to you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain."
verse:3:13 Moses said to God, "Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you;' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' What should I tell them?"
verse:3:14 God said to Moses, "I Shall Be As I Shall Be," and he said, "You shall tell the children of Israel this: 'I Shall Be has sent me to you.'" 
verse:3:15 God said moreover to Moses, "You shall tell the children of Israel this, 'HASHEM, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is My Name forever, and this is My memorial to all generations. 
verse:3:16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and tell them, 'HASHEM, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, "I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt; 
verse:3:17 and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey."' 
verse:3:18 They will listen to your voice, and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall tell him, 'HASHEM, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us go three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to HASHEM, our God.' 
verse:3:19 I know that the king of Egypt won't give you permission to go, no, not by a mighty hand. 
verse:3:20 I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in its midst, and after that he will let you go. 
verse:3:21 I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, and it will happen that when you go, you shall not go empty-handed. 
verse:3:22 But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who visits her house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing; and you shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters. You shall plunder the Egyptians."
verse:4:1 Moses answered, "But, behold, they will not believe me, nor listen to my voice; for they will say, 'HASHEM has not appeared to you.'"
verse:4:2 HASHEM said to him, "What is that in your hand?"
He said, "A rod."
verse:4:3 He said, "Throw it on the ground."
He threw it on the ground, and it became a snake; and Moses ran away from it.
verse:4:4 HASHEM said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand, and take it by the tail."
He stretched out his hand, and took hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand.
verse:4:5 "That they may believe that HASHEM, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you." 
verse:4:6 HASHEM said furthermore to him, "Now put your hand inside your cloak."
He put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.
verse:4:7 He said, "Put your hand inside your cloak again."
He put his hand inside his cloak again, and when he took it out of his cloak, behold, it had turned again as his other flesh.
verse:4:8 "It will happen, if they will neither believe you nor listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. 
verse:4:9 It will happen, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither listen to your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land."
verse:4:10 Moses said to HASHEM, "O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before now, nor since you have spoken to your servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue."
verse:4:11 HASHEM said to him, "Who made man's mouth? Or who makes one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Isn't it I, HASHEM? 
verse:4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall speak."
verse:4:13 He said, "Oh, my Lord, please send someone else."
verse:4:14 The anger of HASHEM was kindled against Moses, and he said, "What about Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Also, behold, he comes out to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart. 
verse:4:15 You shall speak to him, and put the words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do. 
verse:4:16 He will be your spokesman to the people; and it will happen, that he will be to you a mouth, and you will be to him as God. 
verse:4:17 You shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs."
verse:4:18 Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, "Please let me go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive."
Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."
verse:4:19 HASHEM said to Moses in Midian, "Go, return into Egypt; for all the men who sought your life are dead."
verse:4:20 Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. Moses took God's rod in his hand. 
verse:4:21 HASHEM said to Moses, "When you go back into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand, but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go. 
verse:4:22 You shall tell Pharaoh, 'Thus says HASHEM, Israel is my son, my firstborn, 
verse:4:23 and I have said to you, "Let my son go, that he may serve me;" and you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn.'"
verse:4:24 It happened on the way at a lodging place, that HASHEM met Moses and wanted to kill him. 
verse:4:25 Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me."
verse:4:26 So he let him alone. Then she said, "You are a bridegroom of blood," because of the circumcision.
verse:4:27 HASHEM said to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses."
He went, and met him on God's mountain, and kissed him. 
verse:4:28 Moses told Aaron all the words of HASHEM with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had instructed him. 
verse:4:29 Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel. 
verse:4:30 Aaron spoke all the words which HASHEM had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. 
verse:4:31 The people believed, and when they heard that HASHEM had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped.
verse:5:1 Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, "This is what HASHEM, the God of Israel, says, 'Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.'"
verse:5:2 Pharaoh said, "Who is HASHEM, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go? I don't know HASHEM, and moreover I will not let Israel go."
verse:5:3 They said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to HASHEM, our God, lest he fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword."
verse:5:4 The king of Egypt said to them, "Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people from their work? Get back to your burdens!" 
verse:5:5 Pharaoh said, "Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens." 
verse:5:6 The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, 
verse:5:7 "You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
verse:5:8 The number of the bricks, which they made before, you require from them. You shall not diminish anything of it, for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.' 
verse:5:9 Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor therein; and don't let them pay any attention to lying words."
verse:5:10 The taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, "This is what Pharaoh says: 'I will not give you straw. 
verse:5:11 Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished.'" 
verse:5:12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 
verse:5:13 The taskmasters were urgent saying, "Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was straw!" 
verse:5:14 The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, "Why haven't you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today, in making brick as before?"
verse:5:15 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you deal this way with your servants? 
verse:5:16 No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, 'Make brick!' and behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people."
verse:5:17 But he said, "You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to HASHEM.' 
verse:5:18 Go therefore now, and work, for no straw shall be given to you, yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks!"
verse:5:19 The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble, when it was said, "You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!"
verse:5:20 They met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came out from Pharaoh: 
verse:5:21 and they said to them, "May HASHEM look at you, and judge, because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us."
verse:5:22 Moses returned to HASHEM, and said, "My Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why is it that you have sent me? 
verse:5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people; neither have you delivered your people at all."
verse:6:1 HASHEM said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh, for by a strong hand he shall let them go, and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land."
portion:Exodus 6:2 - 9:35
verse:6:2 God spoke to Moses, and said to him, "I am HASHEM; 
verse:6:3 and I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name HASHEM I was not known to them. 
verse:6:4 I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they lived as aliens. 
verse:6:5 Moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant. 
verse:6:6 Therefore tell the children of Israel, 'I am HASHEM, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments: 
verse:6:7 and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and you shall know that I am HASHEM your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 
verse:6:8 I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am HASHEM.'"
verse:6:9 Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they didn't listen to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
verse:6:10 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:6:11 "Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land."
verse:6:12 Moses spoke before HASHEM, saying, "Behold, the children of Israel haven't listened to me. How then shall Pharaoh listen to me, who am of uncircumcised lips?" 
verse:6:13 HASHEM spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a command to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
verse:6:14 These are the heads of their fathers' houses. The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben. 
verse:6:15 The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon. 
verse:6:16 These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi were one hundred thirty-seven years. 
verse:6:17 The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families. 
verse:6:18 The sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred thirty-three years. 
verse:6:19 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations. 
verse:6:20 Amram took Jochebed his father's sister to himself as wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty-seven years. 
verse:6:21 The sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. 
verse:6:22 The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri. 
verse:6:23 Aaron took Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, as his wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
verse:6:24 The sons of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites. 
verse:6:25 Eleazar Aaron's son took one of the daughters of Putiel as his wife; and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites according to their families. 
verse:6:26 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom HASHEM said, "Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies." 
verse:6:27 These are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt. These are that Moses and Aaron.
verse:6:28 It happened on the day when HASHEM spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, 
verse:6:29 that HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, "I am HASHEM. Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you."
verse:6:30 Moses said before HASHEM, "Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh listen to me?"
verse:7:1 HASHEM said to Moses, "Behold, I have made you as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet. 
verse:7:2 You shall speak all that I command you; and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. 
verse:7:3 I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 
verse:7:4 But Pharaoh will not listen to you, and I will lay my hand on Egypt, and bring out my armies, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. 
verse:7:5 The Egyptians shall know that I am HASHEM, when I stretch out my hand on Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them."
verse:7:6 Moses and Aaron did so. As HASHEM commanded them, so they did. 
verse:7:7 Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
verse:7:8 HASHEM spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
verse:7:9 "When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, 'Perform a miracle!' then you shall tell Aaron, 'Take your rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.'"
verse:7:10 Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, as HASHEM had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 
verse:7:11 Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers. They also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same thing with their enchantments. 
verse:7:12 For they each cast down their rods, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. 
verse:7:13 Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them; as HASHEM had spoken.
verse:7:14 HASHEM said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is stubborn. He refuses to let the people go. 
verse:7:15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning. Behold, he goes out to the water; and you shall stand by the river's bank to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand. 
verse:7:16 You shall tell him, 'HASHEM, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, "Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness:" and behold, until now you haven't listened. 
verse:7:17 Thus says HASHEM, "In this you shall know that I am HASHEM. Behold, I will strike with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. 
verse:7:18 The fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river."'" 
verse:7:19 HASHEM said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Take your rod, and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.'"
verse:7:20 Moses and Aaron did so, as HASHEM commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and struck the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. 
verse:7:21 The fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians couldn't drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt. 
verse:7:22 The magicians of Egypt did the same thing with their enchantments; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them; as HASHEM had spoken. 
verse:7:23 Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he didn't even take this to heart. 
verse:7:24 All the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink; for they couldn't drink of the water of the river. 
verse:7:25 Seven days were fulfilled, after HASHEM had struck the river.
verse:7:26 HASHEM spoke to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, "This is what HASHEM says, 'Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
verse:7:27 If you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your borders with frogs: 
verse:7:28 and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your bedroom, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs: 
verse:7:29 and the frogs shall come up both on you, and on your people, and on all your servants.'" 
verse:8:1 HASHEM said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.'" 
verse:8:2 Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 
verse:8:3 The magicians did the same thing with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.
verse:8:4 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, "Entreat HASHEM, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to HASHEM."
verse:8:5 Moses said to Pharaoh, "I give you the honor of setting the time that I should pray for you, and for your servants, and for your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses, and remain in the river only."
verse:8:6 He said, "Tomorrow."
He said, "Be it according to your word, that you may know that there is none like HASHEM our God. 
verse:8:7 The frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people. They shall remain in the river only."
verse:8:8 Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to HASHEM concerning the frogs which he had brought on Pharaoh. 
verse:8:9 HASHEM did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields. 
verse:8:10 They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank. 
verse:8:11 But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart, and didn't listen to them, as HASHEM had spoken.
verse:8:12 HASHEM said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.'" 
verse:8:13 They did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were lice on man, and on animal; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 
verse:8:14 The magicians tried with their enchantments to produce lice, but they couldn't. There were lice on man, and on animal. 
verse:8:15 Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God:" and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them; as HASHEM had spoken.
verse:8:16 HASHEM said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; behold, he comes out to the water; and tell him, 'This is what HASHEM says, "Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
verse:8:17 Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are. 
verse:8:18 I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end you may know that I am HASHEM in the midst of the earth. 
verse:8:19 I will put a division between my people and your people: by tomorrow shall this sign be."'" 
verse:8:20 HASHEM did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses: and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies.
verse:8:21 Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God in the land!"
verse:8:22 Moses said, "It isn't appropriate to do so; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to HASHEM our God. Behold, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and won't they stone us? 
verse:8:23 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to HASHEM our God, as he shall command us."
verse:8:24 Pharaoh said, "I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to HASHEM your God in the wilderness, only you shall not go very far away. Pray for me."
verse:8:25 Moses said, "Behold, I go out from you, and I will pray to HASHEM that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only don't let Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to HASHEM." 
verse:8:26 Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to HASHEM. 
verse:8:27 HASHEM did according to the word of Moses, and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. There remained not one. 
verse:8:28 Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he didn't let the people go.
verse:9:1 Then HASHEM said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, 'This is what HASHEM, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
verse:9:2 For if you refuse to let them go, and hold them still, 
verse:9:3 behold, the hand of HASHEM is on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence. 
verse:9:4 HASHEM will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt; and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel."'" 
verse:9:5 HASHEM appointed a set time, saying, "Tomorrow HASHEM shall do this thing in the land." 
verse:9:6 HASHEM did that thing on the next day; and all the livestock of Egypt died, but of the livestock of the children of Israel, not one died. 
verse:9:7 Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he didn't let the people go.
verse:9:8 HASHEM said to Moses and to Aaron, "Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh. 
verse:9:9 It shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal, throughout all the land of Egypt."
verse:9:10 They took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky; and it became a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal. 
verse:9:11 The magicians couldn't stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were on the magicians, and on all the Egyptians. 
verse:9:12 HASHEM hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he didn't listen to them, as HASHEM had spoken to Moses.
verse:9:13 HASHEM said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, 'This is what HASHEM, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
verse:9:14 For this time I will send all my plagues against your heart, against your officials, and against your people; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth. 
verse:9:15 For now I would have stretched out my hand, and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth; 
verse:9:16 but indeed for this cause I have made you stand: to show you my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth; 
verse:9:17 as you still exalt yourself against my people, that you won't let them go. 
verse:9:18 Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now. 
verse:9:19 Now therefore command that all of your livestock and all that you have in the field be brought into shelter. Every man and animal that is found in the field, and isn't brought home, the hail shall come down on them, and they shall die."'"
verse:9:20 Those who feared the word of HASHEM among the servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their livestock flee into the houses. 
verse:9:21 Whoever didn't respect the word of HASHEM left his servants and his livestock in the field.
verse:9:22 HASHEM said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man, and on animal, and on every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt."
verse:9:23 Moses stretched out his rod toward the heavens, and HASHEM sent thunder, hail, and lightning flashed down to the earth. HASHEM rained hail on the land of Egypt. 
verse:9:24 So there was very severe hail, and lightning mixed with the hail, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 
verse:9:25 The hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and animal; and the hail struck every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field. 
verse:9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.
verse:9:27 Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, "I have sinned this time. HASHEM is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. 
verse:9:28 Pray to HASHEM; for there has been enough of mighty thunderings and hail. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer."
verse:9:29 Moses said to him, "As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to HASHEM. The thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that you may know that the earth is HASHEM's. 
verse:9:30 But as for you and your servants, I know that you don't yet fear HASHEM God."
verse:9:31 The flax and the barley were struck, for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom. 
verse:9:32 But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they had not grown up. 
verse:9:33 Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to HASHEM; and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth. 
verse:9:34 When Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. 
verse:9:35 The heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he didn't let the children of Israel go, just as HASHEM had spoken through Moses.
portion:Exodus 10:1 - 13:16
verse:10:1 HASHEM said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs in their midst, 
verse:10:2 and that you may tell in the hearing of your son, and of your son's son, what things I have done to Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that you may know that I am HASHEM."
verse:10:3 Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him, "This is what HASHEM, the God of the Hebrews, says: 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
verse:10:4 Or else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country, 
verse:10:5 and they shall cover the surface of the earth, so that one won't be able to see the earth. They shall eat the residue of that which has escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field. 
verse:10:6 Your houses shall be filled, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither your fathers nor your fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day.'" He turned, and went out from Pharaoh.
verse:10:7 Pharaoh's servants said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve HASHEM, their God. Don't you yet know that Egypt is destroyed?"
verse:10:8 Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, "Go, serve HASHEM your God; but who are those who will go?"
verse:10:9 Moses said, "We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to HASHEM."
verse:10:10 He said to them, "HASHEM be with you if I will let you go with your little ones! See, evil is clearly before your faces. 
verse:10:11 Not so! Go now you who are men, and serve HASHEM; for that is what you desire!" They were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
verse:10:12 HASHEM said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left." 
verse:10:13 Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt, and HASHEM brought an east wind on the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. 
verse:10:14 The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt. They were very grievous. Before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such. 
verse:10:15 For they covered the surface of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened, and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. There remained nothing green, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt. 
verse:10:16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said, "I have sinned against HASHEM your God, and against you. 
verse:10:17 Now therefore please forgive my sin again, and pray to HASHEM your God, that he may also take away from me this death."
verse:10:18 He went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to HASHEM. 
verse:10:19 HASHEM turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Sea of Suf. There remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt. 
verse:10:20 But HASHEM hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he didn't let the children of Israel go.
verse:10:21 HASHEM said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt." 
verse:10:22 Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days. 
verse:10:23 They didn't see one another, neither did anyone rise from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
verse:10:24 Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, "Go, serve HASHEM. Only let your flocks and your herds stay behind. Let your little ones also go with you."
verse:10:25 Moses said, "You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to HASHEM our God. 
verse:10:26 Our livestock also shall go with us. Not a hoof shall be left behind, for of it we must take to serve HASHEM our God; and we don't know with what we must serve HASHEM, until we come there."
verse:10:27 But HASHEM hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he wouldn't let them go. 
verse:10:28 Pharaoh said to him, "Get away from me! Be careful to see my face no more; for in the day you see my face you shall die!"
verse:10:29 Moses said, "You have spoken well. I will see your face again no more."
verse:11:1 HASHEM said to Moses, "Yet one plague more will I bring on Pharaoh, and on Egypt; afterwards he will let you go. When he lets you go, he will surely thrust you out altogether. 
verse:11:2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold." 
verse:11:3 HASHEM gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.
verse:11:4 Moses said, "This is what HASHEM says: 'About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt, 
verse:11:5 and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of livestock. 
verse:11:6 There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor shall be any more. 
verse:11:7 But against any of the children of Israel a dog won't even bark or move its tongue, against man or animal; that you may know that HASHEM makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel. 
verse:11:8 All these your servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, "Get out, with all the people who follow you;" and after that I will go out.'" He went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
verse:11:9 HASHEM said to Moses, "Pharaoh won't listen to you, that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt." 
verse:11:10 Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and HASHEM hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he didn't let the children of Israel go out of his land.
verse:12:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, 
verse:12:2 "This month shall be to you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year to you. 
verse:12:3 Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, 'On the tenth day of this month, they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household; 
verse:12:4 and if the household is too little for a lamb, then he and his neighbor next to his house shall take one according to the number of the souls; according to what everyone can eat you shall make your count for the lamb. 
verse:12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old. You shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats: 
verse:12:6 and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening. 
verse:12:7 They shall take some of the blood, and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel, on the houses in which they shall eat it. 
verse:12:8 They shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire, and unleavened bread. They shall eat it with bitter herbs. 
verse:12:9 Don't eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire; with its head, its legs and its inner parts. 
verse:12:10 You shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire. 
verse:12:11 This is how you shall eat it: with your belt on your waist, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste: it is HASHEM's Passover. 
verse:12:12 For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and animal. Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am HASHEM. 
verse:12:13 The blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be on you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt. 
verse:12:14 This day shall be to you for a memorial, and you shall keep it a feast to HASHEM: throughout your generations you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever.
verse:12:15 "'Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. 
verse:12:16 In the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no kind of work shall be done in them, except that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you. 
verse:12:17 You shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever. 
verse:12:18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty first day of the month at evening. 
verse:12:19 There shall be no yeast found in your houses for seven days, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a foreigner, or one who is born in the land. 
verse:12:20 You shall eat nothing leavened. In all your habitations you shall eat unleavened bread.'"
verse:12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, "Draw out, and take lambs according to your families, and kill the Passover. 
verse:12:22 You shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning. 
verse:12:23 For HASHEM will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two doorposts, HASHEM will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you. 
verse:12:24 You shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons forever. 
verse:12:25 It shall happen when you have come to the land which HASHEM will give you, according as he has promised, that you shall keep this service. 
verse:12:26 It will happen, when your children ask you, 'What do you mean by this service?' 
verse:12:27 that you shall say, 'It is the sacrifice of HASHEM's Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians, and spared our houses.'"
The people bowed their heads and worshiped. 
verse:12:28 The children of Israel went and did so; as HASHEM had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.
verse:12:29 It happened at midnight, that HASHEM struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of livestock. 
verse:12:30 Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead. 
verse:12:31 He called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, "Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve HASHEM, as you have said! 
verse:12:32 Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also!"
verse:12:33 The Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, "We are all dead men." 
verse:12:34 The people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders. 
verse:12:35 The children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing. 
verse:12:36 HASHEM gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. They despoiled the Egyptians.
verse:12:37 The children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, besides children. 
verse:12:38 A mixed multitude went up also with them, with flocks, herds, and even very much livestock. 
verse:12:39 They baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt; for it wasn't leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn't wait, neither had they prepared for themselves any food. 
verse:12:40 Now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years. 
verse:12:41 It happened at the end of four hundred thirty years, even the same day it happened, that all the armies of HASHEM went out from the land of Egypt. 
verse:12:42 It is a night to be much observed to HASHEM for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of HASHEM, to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations.
verse:12:43 HASHEM said to Moses and Aaron, "This is the ordinance of the Passover. No foreigner shall eat of it, 
verse:12:44 but every man's servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat of it. 
verse:12:45 A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it. 
verse:12:46 In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry out anything of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall you break a bone of it. 
verse:12:47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. 
verse:12:48 When a stranger shall live as a foreigner with you, and will keep the Passover to HASHEM, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one who is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat of it. 
verse:12:49 One law shall be to him who is born at home, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you." 
verse:12:50 All the children of Israel did so. As HASHEM commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did. 
verse:12:51 It happened the same day, that HASHEM brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
verse:13:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:13:2 "Sanctify to me all of the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of animal. It is mine."
verse:13:3 Moses said to the people, "Remember this day, in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand HASHEM brought you out from this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten. 
verse:13:4 This day you go out in the month Abib. 
verse:13:5 It shall be, when HASHEM shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month. 
verse:13:6 Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to HASHEM. 
verse:13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and no leavened bread shall be seen with you, neither shall yeast be seen with you, in all your borders. 
verse:13:8 You shall tell your son in that day, saying, 'It is because of that which HASHEM did for me when I came out of Egypt.' 
verse:13:9 It shall be for a sign to you on your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that the law of HASHEM may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand HASHEM has brought you out of Egypt. 
verse:13:10 You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
verse:13:11 "It shall be, when HASHEM shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and shall give it you, 
verse:13:12 that you shall set apart to HASHEM all that opens the womb, and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal. The males shall be HASHEM's. 
verse:13:13 Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons. 
verse:13:14 It shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, 'What is this?' that you shall tell him, 'By strength of hand HASHEM brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage; 
verse:13:15 and it happened, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that HASHEM killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of animal. Therefore I sacrifice to HASHEM all that opens the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.' 
verse:13:16 It shall be for a sign on your hand, and for symbols between your eyes: for by strength of hand HASHEM brought us out of Egypt."
portion:Exodus 13:17 - 17:16
verse:13:17 It happened, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God didn't lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, "Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and they return to Egypt;" 
verse:13:18 but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Sea of Suf; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt. 
verse:13:19 Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the children of Israel swear, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you." 
verse:13:20 They took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. 
verse:13:21 HASHEM went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them on their way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night: 
verse:13:22 the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, didn't depart from before the people.
verse:14:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:14:2 "Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal Zephon. You shall encamp opposite it by the sea. 
verse:14:3 Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, 'They are entangled in the land. The wilderness has shut them in.' 
verse:14:4 I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will follow after them; and I will get honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies; and the Egyptians shall know that I am HASHEM." They did so.
verse:14:5 It was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, "What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?" 
verse:14:6 He prepared his chariot, and took his army with him; 
verse:14:7 and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them. 
verse:14:8 HASHEM hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand. 
verse:14:9 The Egyptians pursued after them: all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his army; and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal Zephon.
verse:14:10 When Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were very afraid. The children of Israel cried out to HASHEM. 
verse:14:11 They said to Moses, "Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you treated us this way, to bring us out of Egypt? 
verse:14:12 Isn't this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, 'Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?' For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness."
verse:14:13 Moses said to the people, "Don't be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of HASHEM, which he will work for you today: for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you shall never see them again. 
verse:14:14 HASHEM will fight for you, and you shall be still."
verse:14:15 HASHEM said to Moses, "Why do you cry to me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward. 
verse:14:16 Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground. 
verse:14:17 I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them: and I will get myself honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies, over his chariots, and over his horsemen. 
verse:14:18 The Egyptians shall know that I am HASHEM, when I have gotten myself honor over Pharaoh, over his chariots, and over his horsemen." 
verse:14:19 The angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them, and stood behind them. 
verse:14:20 It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and the one didn't come near the other all the night.
verse:14:21 Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and HASHEM caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. 
verse:14:22 The children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left. 
verse:14:23 The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea: all of Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. 
verse:14:24 It happened in the morning watch, that HASHEM looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and confused the Egyptian army. 
verse:14:25 He took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, "Let's flee from the face of Israel, for HASHEM fights for them against the Egyptians!"
verse:14:26 HASHEM said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen." 
verse:14:27 Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it. HASHEM overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. 
verse:14:28 The waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even all Pharaoh's army that went in after them into the sea. There remained not so much as one of them. 
verse:14:29 But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left. 
verse:14:30 Thus HASHEM saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. 
verse:14:31 Israel saw the great work which HASHEM did to the Egyptians, and the people feared HASHEM; and they believed in HASHEM, and in his servant Moses.
verse:15:1 Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to HASHEM, and said, "I will sing to HASHEM, for he has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea. 
verse:15:2 HASHEM is my strength and song. He has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will praise him; my father's God, and I will exalt him. 
verse:15:3 HASHEM is a man of war. HASHEM is his name. 
verse:15:4 He has cast Pharaoh's chariots and his army into the sea. His chosen captains are sunk in the Sea of Suf. 
verse:15:5 The deeps cover them. They went down into the depths like a stone. 
verse:15:6 Your right hand, HASHEM, is glorious in power. Your right hand, HASHEM, dashes the enemy in pieces. 
verse:15:7 In the greatness of your excellency, you overthrow those who  rise up against you. You send forth your wrath. It consumes them as stubble. 
verse:15:8 With the blast of your nostrils, the waters were piled up. The floods stood upright as a heap. The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea. 
verse:15:9 The enemy said, 'I will pursue. I will overtake. I will divide  the spoil. My desire shall be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.' 
verse:15:10 You blew with your wind. The sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters. 
verse:15:11 Who is like you, HASHEM, among the gods? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? 
verse:15:12 You stretched out your right hand. The earth swallowed them.  
verse:15:13 "You, in your loving kindness, have led the people that you  have redeemed. You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation. 
verse:15:14 The peoples have heard. They tremble. Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia. 
verse:15:15 Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed. Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab. All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away. 
verse:15:16 Terror and dread falls on them. By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone-- until your people pass over, HASHEM, until the people pass over who you have purchased. 
verse:15:17 You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of  your inheritance, the place, HASHEM, which you have made for yourself to dwell in; the sanctuary, my Lord, which your hands have established. 
verse:15:18 HASHEM shall reign forever and ever."
verse:15:19 For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and HASHEM brought back the waters of the sea on them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea. 
verse:15:20 Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances. 
verse:15:21 Miriam answered them, "Sing to HASHEM, for he has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea."
verse:15:22 Moses led Israel onward from the Sea of Suf, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. 
verse:15:23 When they came to Marah, they couldn't drink from the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore its name was called Marah. 
verse:15:24 The people murmured against Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?" 
verse:15:25 Then he cried to HASHEM. HASHEM showed him a tree, and he threw it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there he tested them; 
verse:15:26 and he said, "If you will diligently listen to the voice of HASHEM your God, and will do that which is right in his eyes, and will pay attention to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you, which I have put on the Egyptians; for I am HASHEM who heals you."
verse:15:27 They came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.
verse:16:1 They took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. 
verse:16:2 The whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness; 
verse:16:3 and the children of Israel said to them, "We wish that we had died by the hand of HASHEM in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the meat pots, when we ate our fill of bread, for you have brought us out into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger."
verse:16:4 Then HASHEM said to Moses, "Behold, I will rain bread from the sky for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law, or not. 
verse:16:5 It shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily."
verse:16:6 Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, "At evening, then you shall know that HASHEM has brought you out from the land of Egypt; 
verse:16:7 and in the morning, then you shall see the glory of HASHEM; because he hears your murmurings against HASHEM. Who are we, that you murmur against us?" 
verse:16:8 Moses said, "Now HASHEM shall give you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to satisfy you; because HASHEM hears your murmurings which you murmur against him. And who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against HASHEM." 
verse:16:9 Moses said to Aaron, "Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel, 'Come near before HASHEM, for he has heard your murmurings.'" 
verse:16:10 It happened, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of HASHEM appeared in the cloud. 
verse:16:11 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:16:12 "I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, 'At evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread: and you shall know that I am HASHEM your God.'"
verse:16:13 It happened at evening that quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp. 
verse:16:14 When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the frost on the ground. 
verse:16:15 When the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, "What is it?" For they didn't know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread which HASHEM has given you to eat." 
verse:16:16 This is the thing which HASHEM has commanded: "Gather of it everyone according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, you shall take it, every man for those who are in his tent." 
verse:16:17 The children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less. 
verse:16:18 When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They gathered every man according to his eating. 
verse:16:19 Moses said to them, "Let no one leave of it until the morning." 
verse:16:20 Notwithstanding they didn't listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was angry with them. 
verse:16:21 They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted. 
verse:16:22 It happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one, and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. 
verse:16:23 He said to them, "This is that which HASHEM has spoken, 'Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to HASHEM. Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.'" 
verse:16:24 They laid it up until the morning, as Moses asked, and it didn't become foul, neither was there any worm in it. 
verse:16:25 Moses said, "Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to HASHEM. Today you shall not find it in the field. 
verse:16:26 Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be none." 
verse:16:27 It happened on the seventh day, that some of the people went out to gather, and they found none. 
verse:16:28 HASHEM said to Moses, "How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws? 
verse:16:29 Behold, because HASHEM has given you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Everyone stay in his place. Let no one go out of his place on the seventh day." 
verse:16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.
verse:16:31 The house of Israel called its name Manna, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey. 
verse:16:32 Moses said, "This is the thing which HASHEM has commanded, 'Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.'" 
verse:16:33 Moses said to Aaron, "Take a pot, and put an omer-full of manna in it, and lay it up before HASHEM, to be kept throughout your generations." 
verse:16:34 As HASHEM commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. 
verse:16:35 The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan. 
verse:16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an efah.
verse:17:1 All the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to HASHEM's commandment, and encamped in Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink. 
verse:17:2 Therefore the people quarreled with Moses, and said, "Give us water to drink."
Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test HASHEM?"
verse:17:3 The people were thirsty for water there; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?"
verse:17:4 Moses cried to HASHEM, saying, "What shall I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me."
verse:17:5 HASHEM said to Moses, "Walk on before the people, and take the elders of Israel with you, and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile, and go. 
verse:17:6 Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb. You shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink." Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
verse:17:7 He called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because the children of Israel quarreled, and because they tested HASHEM, saying, "Is HASHEM among us, or not?"
verse:17:8 Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 
verse:17:9 Moses said to Joshua, "Choose men for us, and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God's rod in my hand." 
verse:17:10 So Joshua did as Moses had told him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
verse:17:11 It happened, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. 
verse:17:12 But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. His hands were steady until sunset. 
verse:17:13 Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 
verse:17:14 HASHEM said to Moses, "Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky." 
verse:17:15 Moses built an altar, and called its name HASHEM our Banner. 
verse:17:16 He said, "HASHEM has sworn: 'HASHEM will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.'"
portion:Exodus 18:1 - 20:23
verse:18:1 Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that HASHEM had brought Israel out of Egypt. 
verse:18:2 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, received Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away, 
verse:18:3 and her two sons. The name of one son was Gershom, for Moses said, "I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land". 
verse:18:4 The name of the other was Eliezer, for he said, "My father's God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh's sword." 
verse:18:5 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the Mountain of God. 
verse:18:6 He said to Moses, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, have come to you with your wife, and her two sons with her."
verse:18:7 Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed and kissed him. They asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent. 
verse:18:8 Moses told his father-in-law all that HASHEM had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardships that had come on them on the way, and how HASHEM delivered them. 
verse:18:9 Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which HASHEM had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians. 
verse:18:10 Jethro said, "Blessed be HASHEM, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. 
verse:18:11 Now I know that HASHEM is greater than all gods because of the thing in which they dealt arrogantly against them." 
verse:18:12 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. Aaron came with all of the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.
verse:18:13 It happened on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening. 
verse:18:14 When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, "What is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?"
verse:18:15 Moses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to inquire of God. 
verse:18:16 When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws." 
verse:18:17 Moses' father-in-law said to him, "The thing that you do is not good. 
verse:18:18 You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to perform it yourself alone. 
verse:18:19 Listen now to my voice. I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You represent the people before God, and bring the causes to God. 
verse:18:20 You shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do. 
verse:18:21 Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God: men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
verse:18:22 Let them judge the people at all times. It shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge themselves. So shall it be easier for you, and they shall share the load with you. 
verse:18:23 If you will do this thing, and God commands you so, then you will be able to endure, and all of these people also will go to their place in peace."
verse:18:24 So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said. 
verse:18:25 Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
verse:18:26 They judged the people at all times. They brought the hard causes to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. 
verse:18:27 Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into his own land.
verse:19:1 In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. 
verse:19:2 When they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mountain. 
verse:19:3 Moses went up to God, and HASHEM called to him out of the mountain, saying, "This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: 
verse:19:4 'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself. 
verse:19:5 Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice, and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples; for all the earth is mine; 
verse:19:6 and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.' These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel."
verse:19:7 Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which HASHEM commanded him. 
verse:19:8 All the people answered together, and said, "All that HASHEM has spoken we will do."
Moses reported the words of the people to HASHEM. 
verse:19:9 HASHEM said to Moses, "Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever." Moses told the words of the people to HASHEM. 
verse:19:10 HASHEM said to Moses, "Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments, 
verse:19:11 and be ready against the third day; for on the third day HASHEM will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai. 
verse:19:12 You shall set bounds to the people all around, saying, 'Be careful that you don't go up onto the mountain, or touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death. 
verse:19:13 No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.' When the shofar sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain."
verse:19:14 Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. 
verse:19:15 He said to the people, "Be ready by the third day. Don't have sexual relations with a woman."
verse:19:16 It happened on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud shofar; and all the people who were in the camp trembled. 
verse:19:17 Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain. 
verse:19:18 Mount Sinai, all it, smoked, because HASHEM descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly. 
verse:19:19 When the sound of the shofar grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice. 
verse:19:20 HASHEM came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. HASHEM called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
verse:19:21 HASHEM said to Moses, "Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to HASHEM to gaze, and many of them perish. 
verse:19:22 Let the priests also, who come near to HASHEM, sanctify themselves, lest HASHEM break forth on them."
verse:19:23 Moses said to HASHEM, "The people can't come up to Mount Sinai, for you warned us, saying, 'Set bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.'"
verse:19:24 HASHEM said to him, "Go down and you shall bring Aaron up with you, but don't let the priests and the people break through to come up to HASHEM, lest he break forth on them."
verse:19:25 So Moses went down to the people, and told them.
verse:20:1 God spoke all these words, saying, 
verse:20:2 "I am HASHEM your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
verse:20:3 "You shall have no other gods before me.
verse:20:4 "You shall not make for yourselves an idol, nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: 
verse:20:5 you shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them, for I, HASHEM your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me, 
verse:20:6 and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
verse:20:7 "You shall not take the name of HASHEM your God in vain, for HASHEM will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.
verse:20:8 "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 
verse:20:9 You shall labor six days, and do all your work, 
verse:20:10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to HASHEM your God. You shall not do any work in it, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates; 
verse:20:11 for in six days HASHEM made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore HASHEM blessed the Sabbath day, and made it holy.
verse:20:12 "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which HASHEM your God gives you.
verse:20:13 "You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
verse:20:14 "You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's."
verse:20:15 All the people perceived the thunderings, the lightnings, the sound of the shofar, and the mountain smoking. When the people saw it, they trembled, and stayed at a distance. 
verse:20:16 They said to Moses, "Speak with us yourself, and we will listen; but don't let God speak with us, lest we die."
verse:20:17 Moses said to the people, "Don't be afraid, for God has come to test you, and that his fear may be before you, that you won't sin." 
verse:20:18 The people stayed at a distance, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.
verse:20:19 HASHEM said to Moses, "This is what you shall tell the children of Israel: 'You yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. 
verse:20:20 You shall most certainly not make alongside of me gods of silver, or gods of gold for yourselves. 
verse:20:21 You shall make an altar of earth for me, and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I record my name I will come to you and I will bless you. 
verse:20:22 If you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of cut stones; for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it. 
verse:20:23 Neither shall you go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed to it.'
portion:Exodus 21:1 - 24:18

verse:21:4 If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. 
verse:21:5 But if the servant shall plainly say, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children. I will not go out free;'

verse:21:7 "If a man sells his daughter to be a female servant, she shall not go out as the male servants do.

verse:21:20 "If a man strikes his servant or his maid with a rod, and he dies under his hand, he shall surely be punished.

verse:24:1 He said to Moses, "Come up to HASHEM, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship from a distance. 
verse:24:2 Moses alone shall come near to HASHEM, but they shall not come near, neither shall the people go up with him."
verse:24:3 Moses came and told the people all the words of HASHEM, and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice, and said, "All the words which HASHEM has spoken will we do."
verse:24:4 Moses wrote all the words of HASHEM, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the mountain, and twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel. 
verse:24:5 He sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of cattle to HASHEM. 
verse:24:6 Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. 
verse:24:7 He took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people, and they said, "All that HASHEM has spoken will we do, and be obedient."
verse:24:8 Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, "Look, this is the blood of the covenant, which HASHEM has made with you concerning all these words."
verse:24:9 Then Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up. 
verse:24:10 They saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was like a paved work of sapphire stone, like the skies for clearness. 
verse:24:11 He didn't lay his hand on the nobles of the children of Israel. They saw God, and ate and drank.
verse:24:12 HASHEM said to Moses, "Come up to me on the mountain, and stay here, and I will give you the tables of stone with the law and the commands that I have written, that you may teach them."
verse:24:13 Moses rose up with Joshua, his servant, and Moses went up onto God's Mountain. 
verse:24:14 He said to the elders, "Wait here for us, until we come again to you. Behold, Aaron and Hur are with you. Whoever is involved in a dispute can go to them."
verse:24:15 Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. 
verse:24:16 The glory of HASHEM settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. The seventh day he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud. 
verse:24:17 The appearance of the glory of HASHEM was like devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel. 
verse:24:18 Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up on the mountain; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.

verse:31:12 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:31:13 "Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, 'Most certainly you shall keep my Sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am HASHEM who sanctifies you. 
verse:31:14 You shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
verse:31:15 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to HASHEM. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death. 
verse:31:16 Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 
verse:31:17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days HASHEM made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.'"
verse:31:18 He gave to Moses, when he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets, written with God's finger.
verse:32:1 When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, "Come, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him."
verse:32:2 Aaron said to them, "Take off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me."
verse:32:3 All the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron. 
verse:32:4 He received what they handed him, and fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it a molten calf; and they said, "These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt."
verse:32:5 When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, "Tomorrow shall be a feast to HASHEM."
verse:32:6 They rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
verse:32:7 HASHEM spoke to Moses, "Go, get down; for your people, who you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves! 
verse:32:8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, 'These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.'"
verse:32:9 HASHEM said to Moses, "I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people. 
verse:32:10 Now therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation."
verse:32:11 Moses begged HASHEM his God, and said, "HASHEM, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? 
verse:32:12 Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, 'He brought them forth for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?' Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people. 
verse:32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, 'I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your seed, and they shall inherit it forever.'"
verse:32:14 HASHEM repented of the evil which he said he would do to his people.
verse:32:15 Moses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand; tablets that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other they were written. 
verse:32:16 The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tables.
verse:32:17 When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "There is the noise of war in the camp."
verse:32:18 He said, "It isn't the voice of those who shout for victory, neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I hear." 
verse:32:19 It happened, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing: and Moses' anger grew hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mountain. 
verse:32:20 He took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.
verse:32:21 Moses said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?"
verse:32:22 Aaron said, "Don't let the anger of my lord grow hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil. 
verse:32:23 For they said to me, 'Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him.' 
verse:32:24 I said to them, 'Whoever has any gold, let them take it off:' so they gave it to me; and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."
verse:32:25 When Moses saw that the people had broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies), 
verse:32:26 then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, "Whoever is on HASHEM's side, come to me!"
All the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him. 
verse:32:27 He said to them, "Thus says HASHEM, the God of Israel, 'Every man put his sword on his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.'" 
verse:32:28 The sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 
verse:32:29 Moses said, "Consecrate yourselves today to HASHEM, yes, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow on you a blessing this day."
verse:32:30 It happened on the next day, that Moses said to the people, "You have sinned a great sin. Now I will go up to HASHEM. Perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin."
verse:32:31 Moses returned to HASHEM, and said, "Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves gods of gold. 
verse:32:32 Yet now, if you will, forgive their sin--and if not, please blot me out of your book which you have written."
verse:32:33 HASHEM said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. 
verse:32:34 Now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you. Behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin." 
verse:32:35 HASHEM struck the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.
verse:33:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, "Depart, go up from here, you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your seed.' 
verse:33:2 I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 
verse:33:3 to a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of you, for you are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume you in the way."
verse:33:4 When the people heard this evil news, they mourned: and no one put on his jewelry.
verse:33:5 HASHEM said to Moses, "Tell the children of Israel, 'You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go up into your midst for one moment, I would consume you. Therefore now take off your jewelry from you, that I may know what to do to you.'"
verse:33:6 The children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward.
verse:33:7 Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and he called it "The Tent of Meeting." It happened that everyone who sought HASHEM went out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp. 
verse:33:8 It happened that when Moses went out to the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, everyone at their tent door, and watched Moses, until he had gone into the Tent. 
verse:33:9 It happened, when Moses entered into the Tent, that the pillar of cloud descended, stood at the door of the Tent, and spoke with Moses. 
verse:33:10 All the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent, and all the people rose up and worshiped, everyone at their tent door. 
verse:33:11 HASHEM spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. He turned again into the camp, but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, didn't depart out of the Tent.
verse:33:12 Moses said to HASHEM, "Behold, you tell me, 'Bring up this people:' and you haven't let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.' 
verse:33:13 Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you, so that I may find favor in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people."
verse:33:14 He said, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."
verse:33:15 He said to him, "If your presence doesn't go with me, don't carry us up from here. 
verse:33:16 For how would people know that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Isn't it in that you go with us, so that we are separated, I and your people, from all the people who are on the surface of the earth?"
verse:33:17 HASHEM said to Moses, "I will do this thing also that you have spoken; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name."
verse:33:18 He said, "Please show me your glory."
verse:33:19 He said, "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of HASHEM before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy." 
verse:33:20 He said, "You cannot see my face, for man may not see me and live." 
verse:33:21 HASHEM also said, "Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand on the rock. 
verse:33:22 It will happen, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by; 
verse:33:23 then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back; but my face shall not be seen."
verse:34:1 HASHEM said to Moses, "Chisel two stone tablets like the first: and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. 
verse:34:2 Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain. 
verse:34:3 No one shall come up with you; neither let anyone be seen throughout all the mountain; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mountain."
verse:34:4 He chiseled two tablets of stone like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai, as HASHEM had commanded him, and took in his hand two stone tablets. 
verse:34:5 HASHEM descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of HASHEM. 
verse:34:6 HASHEM passed by before him, and proclaimed, "HASHEM! HASHEM, a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth, 
verse:34:7 keeping loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children's children, on the third and on the fourth generation."
verse:34:8 Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped. 
verse:34:9 He said, "If now I have found favor in your sight, my Lord, please let my Lord go in the midst of us; although this is a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance."
verse:34:10 He said, "Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been worked in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which you are shall see the work of HASHEM; for it is an awesome thing that I do with you. 
verse:34:11 Observe that which I command you this day. Behold, I drive out before you the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
verse:34:12 Be careful, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be for a snare in the midst of you: 
verse:34:13 but you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and you shall cut down their Asherim; 
verse:34:14 for you shall worship no other god: for HASHEM, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
verse:34:15 "Don't make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, lest they play the prostitute after their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice; 
verse:34:16 and you take of their daughters to your sons, and their daughters play the prostitute after their gods, and make your sons play the prostitute after their gods.
verse:34:17 "You shall make no cast idols for yourselves.
verse:34:18 "You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.
verse:34:19 "All that opens the womb is mine; and all your livestock that is male, the firstborn of cow and sheep. 
verse:34:20 The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb: and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. No one shall appear before me empty.
verse:34:21 "Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.
verse:34:22 "You shall observe the feast of weeks with the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of harvest at the year's end. 
verse:34:23 Three times in the year all your males shall appear before HASHEM GOD, the God of Israel. 
verse:34:24 For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders; neither shall any man desire your land when you go up to appear before HASHEM, your God, three times in the year.
verse:34:25 "You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover be left to the morning.
verse:34:26 "You shall bring the first of the first fruits of your ground to the house of HASHEM your God.
"You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk."
verse:34:27 HASHEM said to Moses, "Write you these words: for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel."
verse:34:28 He was there with HASHEM forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread, nor drank water. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
verse:34:29 It happened, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mountain, that Moses didn't know that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him. 
verse:34:30 When Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him. 
verse:34:31 Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke to them. 
verse:34:32 Afterward all the children of Israel came near, and he gave them all of the commandments that HASHEM had spoken with him on Mount Sinai. 
verse:34:33 When Moses was done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face. 
verse:34:34 But when Moses went in before HASHEM to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded. 
verse:34:35 The children of Israel saw Moses' face, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
portion:Exodus 35:1 - 38:20
verse:35:1 Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said to them, "These are the words which HASHEM has commanded, that you should do them. 
verse:35:2 'Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be a holy day for you, a Sabbath of solemn rest to HASHEM: whoever does any work in it shall be put to death. 
verse:35:3 You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations on the Sabbath day.'"
verse:35:4 Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, "This is the thing which HASHEM commanded, saying, 
verse:35:5 'Take from among you an offering to HASHEM. Whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, HASHEM's offering: gold, silver, brass, 
verse:35:6 blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats' hair, 
verse:35:7 rams' skins dyed red, sea cow hides, acacia wood, 
verse:35:8 oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense, 
verse:35:9 onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate.
verse:35:10 "'Let every wise-hearted man among you come, and make all that HASHEM has commanded: 
verse:35:11 the tabernacle, its outer covering, its roof, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets; 
verse:35:12 the ark, and its poles, the mercy seat, the veil of the screen; 
verse:35:13 the table with its poles and all its vessels, and the show bread; 
verse:35:14 the menorah also for the light, with its vessels, its lamps, and the oil for the light; 
verse:35:15 and the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil, the sweet incense, the screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle; 
verse:35:16 the altar of burnt offering, with its grating of brass, it poles, and all its vessels, the basin and its base; 
verse:35:17 the hangings of the court, its pillars, their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court; 
verse:35:18 the pins of the tabernacle, the pins of the court, and their cords; 
verse:35:19 the finely worked garments, for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.'"
verse:35:20 All the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 
verse:35:21 They came, everyone whose heart stirred him up, and everyone whom his spirit made willing, and brought HASHEM's offering, for the work of the Tent of Meeting, and for all of its service, and for the holy garments. 
verse:35:22 They came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, and brought brooches, earrings, signet rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold; even every man who offered an offering of gold to HASHEM. 
verse:35:23 Everyone, with whom was found blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats' hair, rams' skins dyed red, and sea cow hides, brought them. 
verse:35:24 Everyone who offered an offering of silver and brass brought HASHEM's offering; and everyone, with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it. 
verse:35:25 All the women who were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, the blue, the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen. 
verse:35:26 All the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats' hair. 
verse:35:27 The rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set, for the ephod and for the breastplate; 
verse:35:28 and the spice, and the oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense. 
verse:35:29 The children of Israel brought a freewill offering to HASHEM; every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which HASHEM had commanded to be made by Moses.
verse:35:30 Moses said to the children of Israel, "Behold, HASHEM has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 
verse:35:31 He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship; 
verse:35:32 and to make skillful works, to work in gold, in silver, in brass, 
verse:35:33 in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of skillful workmanship. 
verse:35:34 He has put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 
verse:35:35 He has filled them with wisdom of heart, to work all kinds of workmanship, of the engraver, of the skillful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of those who do any workmanship, and of those who make skillful works.
verse:36:1 "Bezalel and Oholiab shall work with every wise-hearted man, in whom HASHEM has put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that HASHEM has commanded."
verse:36:2 Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart HASHEM had put wisdom, even everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to the work to do it: 
verse:36:3 and they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, with which to make it. They brought yet to him freewill offerings every morning. 
verse:36:4 All the wise men, who performed all the work of the sanctuary, each came from his work which they did. 
verse:36:5 They spoke to Moses, saying, "The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which HASHEM commanded to make."
verse:36:6 Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, "Let neither man nor woman make anything else for the offering for the sanctuary." So the people were restrained from bringing. 
verse:36:7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
verse:36:8 All the wise-hearted men among those who did the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, blue, purple, and scarlet, with cherubim, the work of the skillful workman, they made them. 
verse:36:9 The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. All the curtains had one measure. 
verse:36:10 He coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled one to another. 
verse:36:11 He made loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain from the edge in the coupling. Likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling. 
verse:36:12 He made fifty loops in the one curtain, and he made fifty loops in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling. The loops were opposite one to another. 
verse:36:13 He made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps: so the tabernacle was a unit.
verse:36:14 He made curtains of goats' hair for a covering over the tabernacle. He made them eleven curtains. 
verse:36:15 The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the breadth of each curtain. The eleven curtains had one measure. 
verse:36:16 He coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. 
verse:36:17 He made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the coupling, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain which was outmost in the second coupling. 
verse:36:18 He made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be a unit. 
verse:36:19 He made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of sea cow hides above.
verse:36:20 He made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing up. 
verse:36:21 Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board. 
verse:36:22 Each board had two tenons, joined one to another. He made all the boards of the tabernacle this way. 
verse:36:23 He made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side southward. 
verse:36:24 He made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons. 
verse:36:25 For the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards, 
verse:36:26 and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 
verse:36:27 For the far part of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. 
verse:36:28 He made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle in the far part. 
verse:36:29 They were double beneath, and in the same way they were all the way to its top to one ring. He did this to both of them in the two corners. 
verse:36:30 There were eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; under every board two sockets.
verse:36:31 He made bars of acacia wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 
verse:36:32 and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward. 
verse:36:33 He made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the one end to the other. 
verse:36:34 He overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold for places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
verse:36:35 He made the veil of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubim. He made it the work of a skillful workman. 
verse:36:36 He made four pillars of acacia for it, and overlaid them with gold. Their hooks were of gold. He cast four sockets of silver for them. 
verse:36:37 He made a screen for the door of the tent, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of an embroiderer; 
verse:36:38 and the five pillars of it with their hooks. He overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold, and their five sockets were of brass.
verse:37:1 Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood. Its length was two and a half cubits, and its breadth a cubit and a half, and a cubit and a half its height. 
verse:37:2 He overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside, and made a molding of gold for it around it. 
verse:37:3 He cast four rings of gold for it, in its four feet; even two rings on its one side, and two rings on its other side. 
verse:37:4 He made poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold. 
verse:37:5 He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark. 
verse:37:6 He made a mercy seat of pure gold. Its length was two and a half cubits, and a cubit and a half its breadth. 
verse:37:7 He made two cherubim of gold. He made them of beaten work, at the two ends of the mercy seat; 
verse:37:8 one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end. He made the cherubim of one piece with the mercy seat at its two ends. 
verse:37:9 The cherubim spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, with their faces toward one another. The faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat.
verse:37:10 He made the table of acacia wood. Its length was two cubits, and its breadth was a cubit, and its height was a cubit and a half. 
verse:37:11 He overlaid it with pure gold, and made a gold molding around it. 
verse:37:12 He made a border of a handbreadth around it, and made a golden molding on its border around it. 
verse:37:13 He cast four rings of gold for it, and put the rings in the four corners that were on its four feet. 
verse:37:14 The rings were close by the border, the places for the poles to carry the table. 
verse:37:15 He made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, to carry the table. 
verse:37:16 He made the vessels which were on the table, its dishes, its spoons, its bowls, and its pitchers with which to pour out, of pure gold.
verse:37:17 He made the menorah of pure gold. He made the menorah of beaten work. Its base, its shaft, its cups, its buds, and its flowers were of one piece with it. 
verse:37:18 There were six branches going out of its sides: three branches of the menorah out of its one side, and three branches of the menorah out of its other side: 
verse:37:19 three cups made like almond blossoms in one branch, a bud and a flower, and three cups made like almond blossoms in the other branch, a bud and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the menorah. 
verse:37:20 In the menorah were four cups made like almond blossoms, its buds and its flowers; 
verse:37:21 and a bud under two branches of one piece with it, and a bud under two branches of one piece with it, and a bud under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of it. 
verse:37:22 Their buds and their branches were of one piece with it. The whole thing was one beaten work of pure gold. 
verse:37:23 He made its seven lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff dishes, of pure gold. 
verse:37:24 He made it of a talent of pure gold, with all its vessels.
verse:37:25 He made the altar of incense of acacia wood. It was square: its length was a cubit, and its breadth a cubit. Its height was two cubits. Its horns were of one piece with it. 
verse:37:26 He overlaid it with pure gold, its top, its sides around it, and its horns. He made a gold molding around it. 
verse:37:27 He made two golden rings for it under its molding crown, on its two ribs, on its two sides, for places for poles with which to carry it. 
verse:37:28 He made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold. 
verse:37:29 He made the holy anointing oil and the pure incense of sweet spices, after the art of the perfumer.
verse:38:1 He made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood. It was square. Its length was five cubits, its breadth was five cubits, and its height was three cubits. 
verse:38:2 He made its horns on its four corners. Its horns were of one piece with it, and he overlaid it with brass. 
verse:38:3 He made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, the shovels, the basins, the forks, and the fire pans. He made all its vessels of brass. 
verse:38:4 He made for the altar a grating of a network of brass, under the ledge around it beneath, reaching halfway up. 
verse:38:5 He cast four rings for the four ends of brass grating, to be places for the poles. 
verse:38:6 He made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with brass. 
verse:38:7 He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it. He made it hollow with planks.
verse:38:8 He made the basin of brass, and its base of brass, out of the mirrors of the ministering women who ministered at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
verse:38:9 He made the court: for the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, one hundred cubits; 
verse:38:10 their pillars were twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.

verse:38:21 This is the amount of material used for the tabernacle, even the Tabernacle of the Testimony, as they were counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest. 
verse:38:22 Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:38:23 With him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a skillful workman, and an embroiderer in blue, in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen.
verse:38:24 All the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the offering, was twenty-nine talents, and seven hundred thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 
verse:38:25 The silver of those who were numbered of the congregation was one hundred talents, and one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 
verse:38:26 a beka a head, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for everyone who passed over to those who were numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty men. 
verse:38:27 The one hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the veil; one hundred sockets for the one hundred talents, a talent for a socket. 
verse:38:28 Of the one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, overlaid their capitals, and made fillets for them. 
verse:38:29 The brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand four hundred shekels. 
verse:38:30 With this he made the sockets to the door of the Tent of Meeting, the bronze altar, the bronze grating for it, all the vessels of the altar, 
verse:38:31 the sockets around the court, the sockets of the gate of the court, all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins around the court.
verse:39:1 Of the blue, purple, and scarlet, they made finely worked garments, for ministering in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:39:2 He made the ephod of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen. 
verse:39:3 They beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, in the purple, in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, the work of the skillful workman. 
verse:39:4 They made shoulder straps for it, joined together. At the two ends it was joined together. 
verse:39:5 The skillfully woven band that was on it, with which to fasten it on, was of the same piece, like its work; of gold, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen; as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:39:6 They worked the onyx stones, enclosed in settings of gold, engraved with the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the children of Israel. 
verse:39:7 He put them on the shoulder straps of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel, as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:39:8 He made the breastplate, the work of a skillful workman, like the work of the ephod; of gold, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen. 
verse:39:9 It was square. They made the breastplate double. Its length was a span, and its breadth a span, being double. 
verse:39:10 They set in it four rows of stones. A row of ruby, topaz, and beryl was the first row; 
verse:39:11 and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and an emerald; 
verse:39:12 and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; 
verse:39:13 and the fourth row, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper. They were enclosed in gold settings. 
verse:39:14 The stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, everyone according to his name, for the twelve tribes. 
verse:39:15 They made on the breastplate chains like cords, of braided work of pure gold. 
verse:39:16 They made two settings of gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. 
verse:39:17 They put the two braided chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate. 
verse:39:18 The other two ends of the two braided chains they put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder straps of the ephod, in its front. 
verse:39:19 They made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, on its edge, which was toward the side of the ephod inward. 
verse:39:20 They made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder straps of the ephod underneath, in its front, close by its coupling, above the skillfully woven band of the ephod. 
verse:39:21 They bound the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be on the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not come loose from the ephod, as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:39:22 He made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue. 
verse:39:23 The opening of the robe in its midst was like the opening of a coat of mail, with a binding around its opening, that it should not be torn. 
verse:39:24 They made on the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, purple, scarlet, and twined linen. 
verse:39:25 They made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates around the skirts of the robe, between the pomegranates; 
verse:39:26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, around the skirts of the robe, to minister in, as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:39:27 They made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons, 
verse:39:28 and the turban of fine linen, and the linen headbands of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen, 
verse:39:29 and the sash of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the embroiderer, as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:39:30 They made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote on it a writing, like the engravings of a signet: "HOLY TO THE HASHEM." 
verse:39:31 They tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it on the turban above, as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:39:32 Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting was finished. The children of Israel did according to all that HASHEM commanded Moses; so they did. 
verse:39:33 They brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent, with all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, its sockets, 
verse:39:34 the covering of rams' skins dyed red, the covering of sea cow hides, the veil of the screen, 
verse:39:35 the ark of the testimony with its poles, the mercy seat, 
verse:39:36 the table, all its vessels, the show bread,

verse:39:41 the finely worked garments for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office. 
verse:39:42 According to all that HASHEM commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work. 
verse:39:43 Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it as HASHEM had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.
verse:40:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:40:2 "On the first day of the first month you shall raise up the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:40:3 You shall put the ark of the testimony in it, and you shall screen the ark with the veil. 
verse:40:4 You shall bring in the table, and set in order the things that are on it. You shall bring in the menorah, and light its lamps. 
verse:40:5 You shall set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.
verse:40:6 "You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:40:7 You shall set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and shall put water therein. 
verse:40:8 You shall set up the court around it, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court.
verse:40:9 "You shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is in it, and shall make it holy, and all its furniture: and it will be holy. 
verse:40:10 You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar will be most holy. 
verse:40:11 You shall anoint the basin and its base, and sanctify it.
verse:40:12 "You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and shall wash them with water. 
verse:40:13 You shall put on Aaron the holy garments; and you shall anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister to me in the priest's office. 
verse:40:14 You shall bring his sons, and put coats on them. 
verse:40:15 You shall anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may minister to me in the priest's office. Their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations." 
verse:40:16 Moses did so. According to all that HASHEM commanded him, so he did.
verse:40:17 It happened in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was raised up. 
verse:40:18 Moses raised up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and raised up its pillars. 
verse:40:19 He spread the covering over the tent, and put the roof of the tabernacle above on it, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:20 He took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the poles on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark. 
verse:40:21 He brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:22 He put the table in the Tent of Meeting, on the side of the tabernacle northward, outside of the veil. 
verse:40:23 He set the bread in order on it before HASHEM, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:24 He put the menorah in the Tent of Meeting, opposite the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. 
verse:40:25 He lit the lamps before HASHEM, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:26 He put the golden altar in the Tent of Meeting before the veil; 
verse:40:27 and he burnt incense of sweet spices on it, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:28 He put up the screen of the door to the tabernacle. 
verse:40:29 He set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:30 He set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water therein, with which to wash. 
verse:40:31 Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and their feet there. 
verse:40:32 When they went into the Tent of Meeting, and when they came near to the altar, they washed, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:33 He raised up the court around the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.
verse:40:34 Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of HASHEM filled the tabernacle. 
verse:40:35 Moses wasn't able to enter into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud stayed on it, and HASHEM's glory filled the tabernacle. 
verse:40:36 When the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys; 
verse:40:37 but if the cloud wasn't taken up, then they didn't travel until the day that it was taken up. 
verse:40:38 For the cloud of HASHEM was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.  Leviticus

verse:5:9 He shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering. 
verse:5:10 He shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin which he has sinned, and he shall be forgiven.
verse:5:11 "'But if he can't afford two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he shall bring his offering for that in which he has sinned, the tenth part of an efah of fine flour for a sin offering. He shall put no oil on it, neither shall he put any frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering. 
verse:5:12 He shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial portion, and burn it on the altar, on the offerings of HASHEM made by fire. It is a sin offering. 
verse:5:13 The priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin that he has sinned in any of these things, and he will be forgiven; and the rest shall be the priest's, as the meal offering.'"
verse:5:14 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:5:15 "If anyone commits a trespass, and sins unwittingly, in the holy things of HASHEM; then he shall bring his trespass offering to HASHEM, a ram without blemish from the flock, according to your estimation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering. 
verse:5:16 He shall make restitution for that which he has done wrong in the holy thing, and shall add a fifth part to it, and give it to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and he will be forgiven.
verse:5:17 "If anyone sins, and does any of the things which HASHEM has commanded not to be done; though he didn't know it, yet he is guilty, and shall bear his iniquity. 
verse:5:18 He shall bring a ram without blemish from of the flock, according to your estimation, for a trespass offering, to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the thing in which he sinned and didn't know it, and he will be forgiven. 
verse:5:19 It is a trespass offering. He is certainly guilty before HASHEM."
verse:5:20 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:5:21 "If anyone sins, and commits a trespass against HASHEM, and deals falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of bargain, or of robbery, or has oppressed his neighbor, 
verse:5:22 or has found that which was lost, and dealt falsely therein, and swearing to a lie; in any of all these things that a man does, sinning therein; 
verse:5:23 then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he has gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was committed to him, or the lost thing which he found, 
verse:5:24 or any thing about which he has sworn falsely; he shall restore it even in full, and shall add a fifth part more to it. To him to whom it belongs he shall give it, in the day of his being found guilty. 
verse:5:25 He shall bring his trespass offering to HASHEM, a ram without blemish from the flock, according to your estimation, for a trespass offering, to the priest. 
verse:5:26 The priest shall make atonement for him before HASHEM, and he will be forgiven concerning whatever he does to become guilty."
portion:Leviticus 6:1 - 8:36
verse:6:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:6:2 "Command Aaron and his sons, saying, 'This is the law of the burnt offering: the burnt offering shall be on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it. 
verse:6:3 The priest shall put on his linen garment, and he shall put on his linen breeches upon his body; and he shall remove the ashes from where the fire has consumed the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar. 
verse:6:4 He shall take off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place. 
verse:6:5 The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it, it shall not go out; and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning: and he shall lay the burnt offering in order upon it, and shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings. 
verse:6:6 Fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually; it shall not go out.
verse:6:7 "'This is the law of the meal offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before HASHEM, before the altar. 
verse:6:8 He shall take from there his handful of the fine flour of the meal offering, and of its oil, and all the frankincense which is on the meal offering, and shall burn it on the altar for a pleasant aroma, as its memorial, to HASHEM. 
verse:6:9 That which is left of it Aaron and his sons shall eat. It shall be eaten without yeast in a holy place. They shall eat it in the court of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:6:10 It shall not be baked with yeast. I have given it as their portion of my offerings made by fire. It is most holy, as the sin offering, and as the trespass offering. 
verse:6:11 Every male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it, as their portion forever throughout your generations, from the offerings of HASHEM made by fire. Whoever touches them shall be holy.'"
verse:6:12 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:6:13 "This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to HASHEM in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an efah of fine flour for a meal offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening. 
verse:6:14 It shall be made with oil in a griddle. When it is soaked, you shall bring it in. You shall offer the meal offering in baked pieces for a pleasant aroma to HASHEM. 
verse:6:15 The anointed priest that will be in his place from among his sons shall offer it. By a statute forever, it shall be wholly burnt to HASHEM. 
verse:6:16 Every meal offering of a priest shall be wholly burned. It shall not be eaten."
verse:6:17 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:6:18 "Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'This is the law of the sin offering: in the place where the burnt offering is killed, the sin offering shall be killed before HASHEM. It is most holy. 
verse:6:19 The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place, in the court of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:6:20 Whatever shall touch its flesh shall be holy. When there is any of its blood sprinkled on a garment, you shall wash that on which it was sprinkled in a holy place. 
verse:6:21 But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken; and if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water. 
verse:6:23 Every male among the priests shall eat of it: it is most holy. 
verse:6:23 No sin offering, of which any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall be eaten: it shall be burned with fire.
verse:7:1 "'This is the law of the trespass offering. It is most holy. 
verse:7:2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering, he shall kill the trespass offering; and its blood he shall sprinkle around on the altar. 
verse:7:3 He shall offer all of its fat: the fat tail, and the fat that covers the innards, 
verse:7:4 and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away; 
verse:7:5 and the priest shall burn them on the altar for an offering made by fire to HASHEM: it is a trespass offering. 
verse:7:6 Every male among the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy place. It is most holy.
verse:7:7 "'As is the sin offering, so is the trespass offering; there is one law for them. The priest who makes atonement with them shall have it. 
verse:7:8 The priest who offers any man's burnt offering, even the priest shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has offered. 
verse:7:9 Every meal offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the pan, and on the griddle, shall be the priest's who offers it. 
verse:7:10 Every meal offering, mixed with oil or dry, belongs to all the sons of Aaron, one as well as another.
verse:7:11 "'This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which one shall offer to HASHEM. 
verse:7:12 If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mixed with oil. 
verse:7:13 With cakes of leavened bread he shall offer his offering with the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving. 
verse:7:14 Of it he shall offer one out of each offering for a heave offering to HASHEM. It shall be the priest's who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings. 
verse:7:15 The flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering. He shall not leave any of it until the morning.
verse:7:16 "'But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow, or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice; and on the next day what remains of it shall be eaten: 
verse:7:17 but what remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire. 
verse:7:18 If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed to him who offers it. It will be an abomination, and the soul who eats any of it will bear his iniquity.
verse:7:19 "'The flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burned with fire. As for the flesh, everyone who is clean may eat it; 
verse:7:20 but the soul who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that belongs to HASHEM, having his uncleanness on him, that soul shall be cut off from his people. 
verse:7:21 When anyone touches any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man, or an unclean animal, or any unclean abomination, and eats some of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which belong to HASHEM, that soul shall be cut off from his people.'"
verse:7:22 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:7:23 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'You shall eat no fat, of bull, or sheep, or goat. 
verse:7:24 The fat of that which dies of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of animals, may be used for any other service, but you shall in no way eat of it. 
verse:7:25 For whoever eats the fat of the animal, of which men offer an offering made by fire to HASHEM, even the soul who eats it shall be cut off from his people. 
verse:7:26 You shall not eat any blood, whether it is of bird or of animal, in any of your dwellings. 
verse:7:27 Whoever it is who eats any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people.'"
verse:7:28 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:7:29 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to HASHEM shall bring his offering to HASHEM out of the sacrifice of his peace offerings. 
verse:7:30 With his own hands he shall bring the offerings of HASHEM made by fire. He shall bring the fat with the breast, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before HASHEM. 
verse:7:31 The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'. 
verse:7:32 The right thigh you shall give to the priest for a heave offering out of the sacrifices of your peace offerings. 
verse:7:33 He among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion. 
verse:7:34 For the waved breast and the heaved thigh I have taken from the children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as their portion forever from the children of Israel.'"
verse:7:35 This is the anointing portion of Aaron, and the anointing portion of his sons, out of the offerings of HASHEM made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister to HASHEM in the priest's office; 
verse:7:36 which HASHEM commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them. It is their portion forever throughout their generations. 
verse:7:37 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings; 
verse:7:38 which HASHEM commanded Moses in Mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their offerings to HASHEM, in the wilderness of Sinai.
verse:8:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:8:2 "Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bull of the sin offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread; 
verse:8:3 and assemble all the congregation at the door of the Tent of Meeting."
verse:8:4 Moses did as HASHEM commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:8:5 Moses said to the congregation, "This is the thing which HASHEM has commanded to be done." 
verse:8:6 Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. 
verse:8:7 He put the coat on him, tied the sash on him, clothed him with the robe, put the ephod on him, and he tied the skillfully woven band of the ephod on him, and fastened it to him with it. 
verse:8:8 He placed the breastplate on him; and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim. 
verse:8:9 He set the turban on his head; and on the turban, in front, he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:8:10 Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and sanctified them. 
verse:8:11 He sprinkled it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the basin and its base, to sanctify them. 
verse:8:12 He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him. 
verse:8:13 Moses brought Aaron's sons, and clothed them with coats, and tied sashes on them, and put headbands on them; as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:8:14 He brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering. 
verse:8:15 He killed it; and Moses took the blood, and put it around on the horns of the altar with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it. 
verse:8:16 He took all the fat that was on the innards, and the cover of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Moses burned it on the altar. 
verse:8:17 But the bull, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp; as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:8:18 He presented the ram of the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 
verse:8:19 He killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood around on the altar. 
verse:8:20 He cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burned the head, and the pieces, and the fat. 
verse:8:21 He washed the innards and the legs with water; and Moses burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma. It was an offering made by fire to HASHEM; as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:8:22 He presented the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 
verse:8:23 He killed it; and Moses took some of its blood, and put it on the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot. 
verse:8:24 He brought Aaron's sons; and Moses put some of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot; and Moses sprinkled the blood around on the altar. 
verse:8:25 He took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the innards, and the cover of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh; 
verse:8:26 and out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before HASHEM, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and on the right thigh. 
verse:8:27 He put all these in Aaron's hands and in his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering before HASHEM. 
verse:8:28 Moses took them from their hands, and burned them on the altar on the burnt offering. They were a consecration for a pleasant aroma. It was an offering made by fire to HASHEM. 
verse:8:29 Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before HASHEM. It was Moses' portion of the ram of consecration, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:8:30 Moses took some of the anointing oil, and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons' garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
verse:8:31 Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, "Boil the flesh at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, 'Aaron and his sons shall eat it.' 
verse:8:32 What remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire. 
verse:8:33 You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration are fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days. 
verse:8:34 What has been done this day, so HASHEM has commanded to do, to make atonement for you. 
verse:8:35 You shall stay at the door of the Tent of Meeting day and night seven days, and keep HASHEM's command, that you don't die: for so I am commanded." 
verse:8:36 Aaron and his sons did all the things which HASHEM commanded by Moses.
portion:Leviticus 9:1 - 11:47
verse:9:1 It happened on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; 
verse:9:2 and he said to Aaron, "Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before HASHEM. 
verse:9:3 You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 
verse:9:4 and a bull and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before HASHEM; and a meal offering mixed with oil: for today HASHEM appears to you.'"
verse:9:5 They brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before HASHEM. 
verse:9:6 Moses said, "This is the thing which HASHEM commanded that you should do: and the glory of HASHEM shall appear to you." 
verse:9:7 Moses said to Aaron, "Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as HASHEM commanded."
verse:9:8 So Aaron drew near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. 
verse:9:9 The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar: 
verse:9:10 but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the sin offering, he burned upon the altar; as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:9:11 The flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp. 
verse:9:12 He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons delivered the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar. 
verse:9:13 They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burned them upon the altar. 
verse:9:14 He washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar. 
verse:9:15 He presented the people's offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, like the first. 
verse:9:16 He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance. 
verse:9:17 He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and burned it upon the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning. 
verse:9:18 He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar, 
verse:9:19 and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver: 
verse:9:20 and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar: 
verse:9:21 and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before HASHEM, as Moses commanded. 
verse:9:22 Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.
verse:9:23 Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of HASHEM appeared to all the people. 
verse:9:24 There came forth fire from before HASHEM, and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
verse:10:1 Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and offered strange fire before HASHEM, which he had not commanded them. 
verse:10:2 And fire came forth from before HASHEM, and devoured them, and they died before HASHEM.
verse:10:3 Then Moses said to Aaron, "This is what HASHEM spoke of, saying, 'I will show myself holy to those who come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified.'"
Aaron held his peace. 
verse:10:4 Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, "Draw near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp." 
verse:10:5 So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
verse:10:6 Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, "Don't let the hair of your heads go loose, neither tear your clothes; that you don't die, and that he not be angry with all the congregation: but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which HASHEM has kindled. 
verse:10:7 You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of HASHEM is on you." They did according to the word of Moses.
verse:10:8 HASHEM spoke to Aaron, saying, 
verse:10:9 "Drink no wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the Tent of Meeting, that you don't die: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations: 
verse:10:10 and that you are to make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean; 
verse:10:11 and that you are to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which HASHEM has spoken to them by Moses."
verse:10:12 Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, "Take the meal offering that remains of the offerings of HASHEM made by fire, and eat it without yeast beside the altar; for it is most holy; 
verse:10:13 and you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion, and your sons' portion, of the offerings of HASHEM made by fire: for so I am commanded. 
verse:10:14 The waved breast and the heaved thigh you shall eat in a clean place, you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they are given as your portion, and your sons' portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel. 
verse:10:15 The heaved thigh and the waved breast they shall bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before HASHEM: and it shall be yours, and your sons' with you, as a portion forever; as HASHEM has commanded."
verse:10:16 Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burned: and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying, 
verse:10:17 "Why haven't you eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since it is most holy, and he has given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before HASHEM? 
verse:10:18 Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary: you certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded."
verse:10:19 Aaron spoke to Moses, "Behold, this day they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before HASHEM; and such things as these have happened to me: and if I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been pleasing in the sight of HASHEM?"
verse:10:20 When Moses heard that, it was pleasing in his sight.
verse:11:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them, 
verse:11:2 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'These are the living things which you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth. 
verse:11:3 Whatever parts the hoof, and is cloven-footed, and chews the cud among the animals, that you may eat.
verse:11:4 "'Nevertheless these you shall not eat of those that chew the cud, or of those who part the hoof: the camel, because he chews the cud but doesn't have a parted hoof, he is unclean to you. 
verse:11:5 The coney, because he chews the cud but doesn't have a parted hoof, he is unclean to you. 
verse:11:6 The hare, because she chews the cud but doesn't part the hoof, she is unclean to you. 
verse:11:7 The pig, because he has a split hoof, and is cloven-footed, but doesn't chew the cud, he is unclean to you. 
verse:11:8 Of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch; they are unclean to you.
verse:11:9 "'These you may eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, that you may eat. 
verse:11:10 All that don't have fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an abomination to you, 
verse:11:11 and you detest them. You shall not eat of their flesh, and you shall detest their carcasses. 
verse:11:12 Whatever has no fins nor scales in the waters, that is an abomination to you.
verse:11:13 "'These you shall detest among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the vulture, and the black vulture, 
verse:11:14 and the red kite, any kind of black kite, 
verse:11:15 any kind of raven, 
verse:11:16 the horned owl, the screech owl, and the gull, any kind of hawk, 
verse:11:17 the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl, 
verse:11:18 the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey, 
verse:11:19 the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat.
verse:11:20 "'All flying insects that walk on all fours are an abomination to you. 
verse:11:21 Yet you may eat these: of all winged creeping things that go on all fours, which have legs above their feet, with which to hop on the earth. 
verse:11:22 Even of these you may eat: any kind of locust, any kind of katydid, any kind of cricket, and any kind of grasshopper. 
verse:11:23 But all winged creeping things which have four feet, are an abomination to you.
verse:11:24 "'By these you will become unclean: whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening. 
verse:11:25 Whoever carries any part of their carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening.
verse:11:26 "'Every animal which parts the hoof, and is not cloven-footed, nor chews the cud, is unclean to you. Everyone who touches them shall be unclean. 
verse:11:27 Whatever goes on its paws, among all animals that go on all fours, they are unclean to you. Whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening. 
verse:11:28 He who carries their carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. They are unclean to you.
verse:11:29 "'These are they which are unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth: the weasel, the rat, any kind of great lizard, 
verse:11:30 the gecko, and the monitor lizard, the wall lizard, the skink, and the chameleon. 
verse:11:31 These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep. Whoever touches them when they are dead, shall be unclean until the evening. 
verse:11:32 On whatever any of them falls when they are dead, it shall be unclean; whether it is any vessel of wood, or clothing, or skin, or sack, whatever vessel it is, with which any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening; then it will be clean. 
verse:11:33 Every earthen vessel, into which any of them falls, all that is in it shall be unclean, and you shall break it. 
verse:11:34 All food which may be eaten, that on which water comes, shall be unclean; and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean. 
verse:11:35 Everything whereupon part of their carcass falls shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces: they are unclean, and shall be unclean to you. 
verse:11:36 Nevertheless a spring or a cistern in which water is a gathered shall be clean: but that which touches their carcass shall be unclean. 
verse:11:37 If part of their carcass falls on any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean. 
verse:11:38 But if water is put on the seed, and part of their carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you.
verse:11:39 "'If any animal, of which you may eat, dies; he who touches its carcass shall be unclean until the evening.

verse:12:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:12:2 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'If a woman conceives, and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of her monthly period she shall be unclean. 
verse:12:3 In the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. 
verse:12:4 She shall continue in the blood of purification thirty-three days. She shall not touch any holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed.

verse:13:2 "When a man shall have a rising in his body's skin, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it becomes in the skin of his body the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons, the priests: 
verse:13:3 and the priest shall examine the plague in the skin of the body: and if the hair in the plague has turned white, and the appearance of the plague is deeper than the body's skin, it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall examine him, and pronounce him unclean. 
verse:13:4 If the bright spot is white in the skin of his body, and its appearance isn't deeper than the skin, and its hair hasn't turned white, then the priest shall isolate the infected person for seven days.

verse:13:7 But if the scab spreads on the skin, after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again. 
verse:13:8 The priest shall examine him; and behold, if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is leprosy.
verse:13:9 "When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest; 
verse:13:10 and the priest shall examine him. Behold, if there is a white rising in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the rising, 
verse:13:11 it is a chronic leprosy in the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. He shall not isolate him, for he is unclean.

verse:13:41 If his hair has fallen off from the front part of his head, he is forehead bald. He is clean. 
verse:13:42 But if there is in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague; it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead. 
verse:13:43 Then the priest shall examine him; and, behold, if the rising of the plague is reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh, 
verse:13:44 he is a leprous man. He is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce him unclean. His plague is on his head.

verse:13:50 The priest shall examine the plague, and isolate the plague seven days. 
verse:13:51 He shall examine the plague on the seventh day. If the plague has spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever use the skin is used for, the plague is a destructive mildew. It is unclean.

verse:13:55 Then the priest shall examine it, after the plague is washed; and behold, if the plague hasn't changed its color, and the plague hasn't spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire. It is a mildewed spot, whether the bareness is inside or outside. 
verse:13:56 If the priest looks, and behold, the plague has faded after it is washed, then he shall tear it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: 
verse:13:57 and if it appears again in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is spreading. You shall burn with fire that in which the plague is. 
verse:13:58 The garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatever thing of skin it is, which you shall wash, if the plague has departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and it will be clean."

verse:14:4 then the priest shall command them to take for him who is to be cleansed two living clean birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. 
verse:14:5 The priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water. 
verse:14:6 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water. 
verse:14:7 He shall sprinkle on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird go into the open field.

verse:14:13 He shall kill the male lamb in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the sanctuary; for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering. It is most holy.

verse:14:37 He shall examine the plague; and behold, if the plague is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and it appears to be deeper than the wall; 
verse:14:38 then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days. 
verse:14:39 The priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look. If the plague has spread in the walls of the house, 
verse:14:40 then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the plague, and cast them into an unclean place outside of the city: 
verse:14:41 and he shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped all over, and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scraped off, outside of the city into an unclean place. 
verse:14:42 They shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.
verse:14:43 "If the plague comes again, and breaks out in the house, after he has taken out the stones, and after he has scraped the house, and after it was plastered; 
verse:14:44 then the priest shall come in and look; and behold, if the plague has spread in the house, it is a destructive mildew in the house. It is unclean. 
verse:14:45 He shall break down the house, its stones, and its timber, and all the house's mortar. He shall carry them out of the city into an unclean place.
verse:14:46 "Moreover he who goes into the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening. 
verse:14:47 He who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes; and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.
verse:14:48 "If the priest shall come in, and examine it, and behold, the plague hasn't spread in the house, after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed. 
verse:14:49 To cleanse the house he shall take two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. 
verse:14:50 He shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.

verse:16:21 Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them on the head of the goat, and shall send him away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who is in readiness. 
verse:16:22 The goat shall carry all their iniquities on himself to a solitary land, and he shall let the goat go in the wilderness.
verse:16:23 "Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and shall take off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the Holy Place, and shall leave them there. 
verse:16:24 Then he shall bathe himself in water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and come out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people. 
verse:16:25 The fat of the sin offering he shall burn on the altar.
verse:16:26 "He who lets the goat go for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp. 
verse:16:27 The bull for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall be carried forth outside the camp; and they shall burn their skins, their flesh, and their dung with fire. 
verse:16:28 He who burns them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
verse:16:29 "It shall be a statute to you forever: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and shall do no kind of work, the native-born, or the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you: 
verse:16:30 for on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins you shall be clean before HASHEM. 
verse:16:31 It is a Sabbath of solemn rest to you, and you shall afflict your souls; it is a statute forever. 
verse:16:32 The priest, who is anointed and who is consecrated to be priest in his father's place, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments. 
verse:16:33 Then he shall make atonement for the Holy Sanctuary; and he shall make atonement for the Tent of Meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
verse:16:34 "This shall be an everlasting statute for you, to make atonement for the children of Israel once in the year because of all their sins."
It was done as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:17:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:17:2 "Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them: 'This is the thing which HASHEM has commanded, 
verse:17:3 Whatever man there is of the house of Israel, who kills a bull, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or who kills it outside the camp, 
verse:17:4 and hasn't brought it to the door of the Tent of Meeting, to offer it as an offering to HASHEM before the tabernacle of HASHEM: blood shall be imputed to that man. He has shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people. 
verse:17:5 This is to the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, that they may bring them to HASHEM, to the door of the Tent of Meeting, to the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace offerings to HASHEM. 
verse:17:6 The priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of HASHEM at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and burn the fat for a pleasant aroma to HASHEM. 
verse:17:7 They shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat idols, after which they play the prostitute. This shall be a statute forever to them throughout their generations.'
verse:17:8 "You shall say to them, 'Any man there is of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice, 
verse:17:9 and doesn't bring it to the door of the Tent of Meeting, to sacrifice it to HASHEM; that man shall be cut off from his people.
verse:17:10 "'Any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them, who eats any kind of blood, I will set my face against that soul who eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people. 
verse:17:11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life. 
verse:17:12 Therefore I have said to the children of Israel, "No person among you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger who lives as a foreigner among you eat blood."
verse:17:13 "'Whatever man there is of the children of Israel, or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them, who takes in hunting any animal or bird that may be eaten; he shall pour out its blood, and cover it with dust. 
verse:17:14 For as to the life of all flesh, its blood is with its life: therefore I said to the children of Israel, "You shall not eat the blood of any kind of flesh; for the life of all flesh is its blood. Whoever eats it shall be cut off."
verse:17:15 "'Every person that eats what dies of itself, or that which is torn by animals, whether he is native-born or a foreigner, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening: then he shall be clean. 
verse:17:16 But if he doesn't wash them, or bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.'"
verse:18:1 HASHEM said to Moses, 
verse:18:2 "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, 'I am HASHEM your God. 
verse:18:3 You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt, where you lived: and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you; neither shall you walk in their statutes. 
verse:18:4 You shall do my ordinances, and you shall keep my statutes, and walk in them: I am HASHEM your God. 
verse:18:5 You shall therefore keep my statutes and my ordinances; which if a man does, he shall live in them: I am HASHEM.
verse:18:6 "'None of you shall approach anyone who are his close relatives, to uncover their nakedness: I am HASHEM.
verse:18:7 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, nor the nakedness of your mother: she is your mother. You shall not uncover her nakedness.

verse:18:9 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or the daughter of your mother, whether born at home, or born abroad.
verse:18:10 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son's daughter, or of your daughter's daughter, even their nakedness: for theirs is your own nakedness.
verse:18:11 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife's daughter, conceived by your father, since she is your sister.
verse:18:12 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister: she is your father's near kinswoman.
verse:18:13 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister: for she is your mother's near kinswoman.
verse:18:14 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's brother, you shall not approach his wife: she is your aunt.

verse:18:16 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife: it is your brother's nakedness.
verse:18:17 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter. You shall not take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are near kinswomen: it is wickedness.
verse:18:18 "'You shall not take a wife to her sister, to be a rival, to uncover her nakedness, while her sister is yet alive.
verse:18:19 "'You shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness.
verse:18:20 "'You shall not lie carnally with your neighbor's wife, and defile yourself with her.
verse:18:21 "'You shall not give any of your children to sacrifice to Molech; neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am HASHEM.
verse:18:22 "'You shall not lie with a man, as with a woman. That is detestable.
verse:18:23 "'You shall not lie with any animal to defile yourself with it; neither shall any woman give herself to an animal, to lie down with it: it is a perversion.
verse:18:24 "'Don't defile yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations which I am casting out before you were defiled. 
verse:18:25 The land was defiled: therefore I punished its iniquity, and the land vomited out her inhabitants. 
verse:18:26 You therefore shall keep my statutes and my ordinances, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the native-born, nor the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you; 
verse:18:27 (for all these abominations have the men of the land done, that were before you, and the land became defiled); 
verse:18:28 that the land not vomit you out also, when you defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.
verse:18:29 "'For whoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people. 
verse:18:30 Therefore you shall keep my requirements, that you do not practice any of these abominable customs, which were practiced before you, and that you do not defile yourselves with them: I am HASHEM your God.'"

verse:19:7 If it is eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination. It will not be accepted;

portion:Leviticus 21:1 - 24:23
verse:21:1 HASHEM said to Moses, "Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them, 'A priest shall not defile himself for the dead among his people; 
verse:21:2 except for his relatives that are near to him: for his mother, for his father, for his son, for his daughter, for his brother, 
verse:21:3 and for his virgin sister who is near to him, who has had no husband; for her he may defile himself. 
verse:21:4 He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.
verse:21:5 "'They shall not shave their heads, neither shall they shave off the corners of their beards, nor make any cuttings in their flesh. 
verse:21:6 They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of their God; for they offer the offerings of HASHEM made by fire, the bread of their God; therefore they shall be holy.
verse:21:7 "'They shall not marry a woman who is a prostitute, or profane; neither shall they marry a woman divorced from her husband: for he is holy to his God. 
verse:21:8 You shall sanctify him therefore; for he offers the bread of your God: he shall be holy to you: for I HASHEM, who sanctify you, am holy.
verse:21:9 "'The daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by playing the prostitute, she profanes her father: she shall be burned with fire.
verse:21:10 "'He who is the high priest among his brothers, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head hang loose, nor tear his clothes; 
verse:21:11 neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother; 
verse:21:12 neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him. I am HASHEM.
verse:21:13 "'He shall take a wife in her virginity. 
verse:21:14 A widow, or one divorced, or a woman who has been defiled, or a prostitute, these he shall not marry: but a virgin of his own people shall he take as a wife. 
verse:21:15 He shall not profane his seed among his people: for I am HASHEM who sanctifies him.'"
verse:21:16 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:21:17 "Say to Aaron, 'None of your seed throughout their generations who has a blemish, may approach to offer the bread of his God. 
verse:21:18 For whatever man he is that has a blemish, he shall not draw near: a blind man, or a lame, or he who has a flat nose, or any deformity, 
verse:21:19 or a man who has an injured foot, or an injured hand, 
verse:21:20 or hunchbacked, or a dwarf, or one who has a defect in his eye, or an itching disease, or scabs, or who has damaged testicles; 
verse:21:21 no man of the seed of Aaron the priest who has a blemish, shall come near to offer the offerings of HASHEM made by fire. Since he has a blemish, he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God. 
verse:21:22 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy. 
verse:21:23 He shall not come near to the veil, nor come near to the altar, because he has a blemish; that he may not profane my sanctuaries, for I am HASHEM who sanctifies them.'"
verse:21:24 So Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel.
verse:22:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:22:2 "Tell Aaron and his sons to separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they make holy to me, and that they not profane my holy name. I am HASHEM.
verse:22:3 "Tell them, 'If anyone of all your seed throughout your generations approaches the holy things, which the children of Israel make holy to HASHEM, having his uncleanness on him, that soul shall be cut off from before me. I am HASHEM.
verse:22:4 "'Whoever of the seed of Aaron is a leper or has an issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he is clean. Whoever touches anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goes from him; 
verse:22:5 or whoever touches any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatever uncleanness he has; 
verse:22:6 the person that touches any such shall be unclean until the evening, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his body in water. 
verse:22:7 When the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread. 
verse:22:8 That which dies of itself, or is torn by animals, he shall not eat, defiling himself by it. I am HASHEM.
verse:22:9 "'They shall therefore follow my requirements, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it. I am HASHEM who sanctifies them.
verse:22:10 "'No stranger shall eat of the holy thing: a foreigner living with the priests, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing. 
verse:22:11 But if a priest buys a slave, purchased by his money, he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread. 
verse:22:12 If a priest's daughter is married to an outsider, she shall not eat of the heave offering of the holy things. 
verse:22:13 But if a priest's daughter is a widow, or divorced, and has no child, and has returned to her father's house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father's bread: but no stranger shall eat any of it.
verse:22:14 "'If a man eats something holy unwittingly, then he shall add the fifth part of its value to it, and shall give the holy thing to the priest. 
verse:22:15 The priests shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer to HASHEM, 
verse:22:16 and so cause them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt, when they eat their holy things: for I am HASHEM who sanctifies them.'"
verse:22:17 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:22:18 "Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, 'Whoever is of the house of Israel, or of the foreigners in Israel, who offers his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill offerings, which they offer to HASHEM for a burnt offering; 
verse:22:19 that you may be accepted, you shall offer a male without blemish, of the bulls, of the sheep, or of the goats. 
verse:22:20 But whatever has a blemish, that you shall not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you. 
verse:22:21 Whoever offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to HASHEM to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; no blemish shall be therein. 
verse:22:22 Blind, injured, maimed, having a wart, festering, or having a running sore, you shall not offer these to HASHEM, nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to HASHEM. 
verse:22:23 Either a bull or a lamb that has any deformity or lacking in his parts, that you may offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted. 
verse:22:24 That which has its testicles bruised, crushed, broken, or cut, you shall not offer to HASHEM; neither shall you do thus in your land. 
verse:22:25 Neither shall you offer the bread of your God from the hand of a foreigner of any of these; because their corruption is in them. There is a blemish in them. They shall not be accepted for you.'"
verse:22:26 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:22:27 "When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat, is born, then it shall remain seven days with its mother; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the offering of an offering made by fire to HASHEM. 
verse:22:28 Whether it is a cow or ewe, you shall not kill it and its young both in one day.
verse:22:29 "When you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to HASHEM, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted. 
verse:22:30 It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall leave none of it until the morning. I am HASHEM.
verse:22:31 "Therefore you shall keep my commandments, and do them. I am HASHEM. 
verse:22:32 You shall not profane my holy name, but I will be made holy among the children of Israel. I am HASHEM who makes you holy, 
verse:22:33 who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. I am HASHEM."
verse:23:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:23:2 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'The set feasts of HASHEM, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts.
verse:23:3 "'Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; you shall do no kind of work. It is a Sabbath to HASHEM in all your dwellings.
verse:23:4 "'These are the set feasts of HASHEM, even holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their appointed season. 
verse:23:5 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, is HASHEM's Passover. 
verse:23:6 On the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread to HASHEM. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. 
verse:23:7 In the first day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no regular work. 
verse:23:8 But you shall offer an offering made by fire to HASHEM seven days. In the seventh day is a holy convocation: you shall do no regular work.'"
verse:23:9 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:23:10 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you have come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap its the harvest, then you shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest: 
verse:23:11 and he shall wave the sheaf before HASHEM, to be accepted for you. On the next day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it. 
verse:23:12 On the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt offering to HASHEM.

verse:23:14 You shall eat neither bread, nor roasted grain, nor fresh grain, until this same day, until you have brought the offering of your God. This is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
verse:23:15 "'You shall count from the next day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven Sabbaths shall be completed:

verse:23:19 You shall offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace offerings. 
verse:23:20 The priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before HASHEM, with the two lambs. They shall be holy to HASHEM for the priest.

verse:23:22 "'When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap into the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest: you shall leave them for the poor, and for the foreigner. I am HASHEM your God.'"
verse:23:23 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:23:24 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest to you, a memorial of blowing of shofars, a holy convocation. 
verse:23:25 You shall do no regular work; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to HASHEM.'"
verse:23:26 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:23:27 "However on the tenth day of this seventh month is Yom Kippur: it shall be a holy convocation to you, and you shall afflict yourselves; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to HASHEM. 
verse:23:28 You shall do no kind of work in that same day; for it is Yom Kippur, to make atonement for you before HASHEM your God. 
verse:23:29 For whoever it is who shall not deny himself in that same day; shall be cut off from his people. 
verse:23:30 Whoever it is who does any kind of work in that same day, that person I will destroy from among his people. 
verse:23:31 You shall do no kind of work: it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
verse:23:32 It shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for you, and you shall deny yourselves. In the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall keep your Sabbath."
verse:23:33 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:23:34 "Speak to the children of Israel, and say, 'On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of booths for seven days to HASHEM. 
verse:23:35 On the first day shall be a holy convocation: you shall do no regular work. 
verse:23:36 Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to HASHEM. On the eighth day shall be a holy convocation to you; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to HASHEM. It is a solemn assembly; you shall do no regular work.
verse:23:37 "'These are the appointed feasts of HASHEM, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to HASHEM, a burnt offering, and a meal offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, each on its own day; 
verse:23:38 besides the Sabbaths of HASHEM, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill offerings, which you give to HASHEM.
verse:23:39 "'So on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruits of the land, you shall keep the feast of HASHEM seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest. 
verse:23:40 You shall take on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before HASHEM your God seven days. 
verse:23:41 You shall keep it a feast to HASHEM seven days in the year: it is a statute forever throughout your generations; you shall keep it in the seventh month. 
verse:23:42 You shall dwell in booths seven days. All who are native-born in Israel shall dwell in booths, 
verse:23:43 that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am HASHEM your God.'"
verse:23:44 Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed feasts of HASHEM.
verse:24:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:24:2 "Command the children of Israel, that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually. 
verse:24:3 Outside of the veil of the Testimony, in the Tent of Meeting, shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before HASHEM continually: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations. 
verse:24:4 He shall keep in order the lamps on the pure gold menorah before HASHEM continually.
verse:24:5 "You shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it: two tenth parts of an efah shall be in one cake. 
verse:24:6 You shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure gold table before HASHEM. 
verse:24:7 You shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to HASHEM. 
verse:24:8 Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before HASHEM continually. It is on the behalf of the children of Israel an everlasting covenant. 
verse:24:9 It shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy to him of the offerings of HASHEM made by fire by a perpetual statute."
verse:24:10 The son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp. 
verse:24:11 The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him to Moses. His mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. 
verse:24:12 They put him in custody, until the will of HASHEM should be declared to them.
verse:24:13 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:24:14 "Bring out of the camp him who cursed; and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him. 
verse:24:15 You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin. 
verse:24:16 He who blasphemes the name of HASHEM, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: the foreigner as well as the native-born, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.
verse:24:17 "'He who strikes any man mortally shall surely be put to death. 
verse:24:18 He who strikes an animal mortally shall make it good, life for life. 
verse:24:19 If anyone injures his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him: 
verse:24:20 fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he has injured someone, so shall it be done to him. 
verse:24:21 He who kills an animal shall make it good; and he who kills a man shall be put to death. 
verse:24:22 You shall have one kind of law, for the foreigner as well as the native-born: for I am HASHEM your God.'"
verse:24:23 Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they brought out him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. The children of Israel did as HASHEM commanded Moses.

verse:25:1 HASHEM said to Moses in Mount Sinai, 
verse:25:2 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you come into the land which I give you, then the land shall keep a Sabbath to HASHEM. 
verse:25:3 Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard, and gather in its fruits; 
verse:25:4 but in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a Sabbath to HASHEM. You shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard. 
verse:25:5 What grows of itself in your harvest you shall not reap, and the grapes of your undressed vine you shall not gather. It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land. 
verse:25:6 The Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for yourself, for your servant, for your maid, for your hired servant, and for your stranger, who lives as a foreigner with you. 
verse:25:7 For your livestock also, and for the animals that are in your land, shall all its increase be for food.

verse:25:10 You shall make the fiftieth year holy, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee to you; and each of you shall return to his own property, and each of you shall return to his family. 
verse:25:11 That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you. In it you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself, nor gather from the undressed vines. 
verse:25:12 For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat of its increase out of the field.
verse:25:13 "'In this Year of Jubilee each of you shall return to his property.
verse:25:14 "'If you sell anything to your neighbor, or buy from your neighbor, you shall not wrong one another.

verse:25:18 "'Therefore you shall do my statutes, and keep my ordinances and do them; and you shall dwell in the land in safety. 
verse:25:19 The land shall yield its fruit, and you shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety. 
verse:25:20 If you said, "What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase;" 
verse:25:21 then I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years. 
verse:25:22 You shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in, you shall eat the old store.

verse:25:27 then let him reckon the years since its sale, and restore the surplus to the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return to his property. 
verse:25:28 But if he isn't able to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the hand of him who has bought it until the Year of Jubilee: and in the Jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return to his property.

verse:25:33 The Levites may redeem the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, and it shall be released in the Jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel. 
verse:25:34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.

verse:25:51 If there are yet many years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for. 
verse:25:52 If there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according to his years of service he shall give back the price of his redemption.

verse:26:46 These are the statutes, ordinances and laws, which HASHEM made between him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses.
verse:27:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:27:2 "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, 'When a man makes a vow, the persons shall be for HASHEM by your valuation. 
verse:27:3 Your valuation shall be of a male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 
verse:27:4 If it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels. 
verse:27:5 If the person is from five years old even to twenty years old, then your valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels. 
verse:27:6 If the person is from a month old even to five years old, then your valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver, and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver. 
verse:27:7 If the person is from sixty years old and upward; if it is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels. 
verse:27:8 But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him who vowed shall the priest value him.
verse:27:9 "'If it is an animal, of which men offer an offering to HASHEM, all that any man gives of such to HASHEM becomes holy. 
verse:27:10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy. 
verse:27:11 If it is any unclean animal, of which they do not offer as an offering to HASHEM, then he shall set the animal before the priest; 
verse:27:12 and the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad. As you the priest values it, so shall it be. 
verse:27:13 But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to its valuation.
verse:27:14 "'When a man dedicates his house to be holy to HASHEM, then the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad: as the priest shall evaluate it, so shall it stand. 
verse:27:15 If he who dedicates it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be his.
verse:27:16 "'If a man dedicates to HASHEM part of the field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it: the sowing of a omer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver. 
verse:27:17 If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand. 
verse:27:18 But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the Year of Jubilee; and an abatement shall be made from your valuation. 
verse:27:19 If he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall remain his. 
verse:27:20 If he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more; 
verse:27:21 but the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy to HASHEM, as a field devoted; it shall be owned by the priests.
verse:27:22 "'If he dedicates to HASHEM a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession, 
verse:27:23 then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to the Year of Jubilee; and he shall give your valuation on that day, as a holy thing to HASHEM. 
verse:27:24 In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs. 
verse:27:25 All your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs to the shekel.
verse:27:26 "'Only the firstborn among animals, which is made a firstborn to HASHEM, no man may dedicate it; whether an ox or sheep, it is HASHEM's. 
verse:27:27 If it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back according to your valuation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it: or if it isn't redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.
verse:27:28 "'Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to HASHEM of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to HASHEM.
verse:27:29 "'No one devoted, who shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
verse:27:30 "'All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is HASHEM's. It is holy to HASHEM. 
verse:27:31 If a man redeems anything of his tithe, he shall add a fifth part to it. 
verse:27:32 All the tithe of the herds or the flocks, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to HASHEM. 
verse:27:33 He shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he changes it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy. It shall not be redeemed.'"
verse:27:34 These are the commandments which HASHEM commanded Moses for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai.

verse:3:14 HASHEM spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying, 
verse:3:15 "Count the children of Levi by their fathers' houses, by their families. You shall count every male from a month old and upward."

verse:4:16 "The duty of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be the oil for the light, the sweet incense, the continual meal offering, and the anointing oil, the requirements of all the tabernacle, and of all that is in it, the sanctuary, and its furnishings."

verse:5:3 Both you shall put male and female outside of the camp; that they not defile their camp, in the midst of which I dwell."
verse:5:4 The children of Israel did so, and put them out outside of the camp; as HASHEM spoke to Moses, so did the children of Israel.
verse:5:5 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:5:6 "Speak to the children of Israel: 'When a man or woman commits any sin that men commit, so as to trespass against HASHEM, and that soul is guilty; 
verse:5:7 then he shall confess his sin which he has done, and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add to it the fifth part of it, and give it to him in respect of whom he has been guilty. 
verse:5:8 But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made to HASHEM shall be the priest's; besides the ram of the atonement, by which atonement shall be made for him. 
verse:5:9 Every heave offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they present to the priest, shall be his. 
verse:5:10 Every man's holy things shall be his: whatever any man gives the priest, it shall be his.'"
verse:5:11 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:5:12 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them: 'If any man's wife goes astray, and is unfaithful to him, 
verse:5:13 and a man lies with her carnally, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband, and is kept close, and she is defiled, and there is no witness against her, and she isn't taken in the act; 
verse:5:14 and the spirit of jealousy comes on him, and he is jealous of his wife, and she is defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy comes on him, and he is jealous of his wife, and she isn't defiled: 
verse:5:15 then the man shall bring his wife to the priest, and shall bring her offering for her: the tenth part of an efah of barley meal. He shall pour no oil on it, nor put frankincense on it, for it is a meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to memory. 
verse:5:16 The priest shall bring her near, and set her before HASHEM; 
verse:5:17 and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water. 
verse:5:18 The priest shall set the woman before HASHEM, and let the hair of the woman's head go loose, and put the meal offering of memorial in her hands, which is the meal offering of jealousy. The priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that brings a curse. 
verse:5:19 The priest shall cause her to swear, and shall tell the woman, "If no man has lain with you, and if you haven't gone aside to uncleanness, being under your husband, be free from this water of bitterness that brings a curse. 
verse:5:20 But if you have gone astray, being under your husband, and if you are defiled, and some man has lain with you besides your husband:" 
verse:5:21 then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall tell the woman, "HASHEM make you a curse and an oath among your people, when HASHEM allows your thigh to fall away, and your body to swell; 
verse:5:22 and this water that brings a curse will go into your bowels, and make your body swell, and your thigh fall away." The woman shall say, "Amen, Amen."
verse:5:23 "'The priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness. 
verse:5:24 He shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causes the curse; and the water that causes the curse shall enter into her and become bitter. 
verse:5:25 The priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the meal offering before HASHEM, and bring it to the altar. 
verse:5:26 The priest shall take a handful of the meal offering, as its memorial, and burn it on the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water. 
verse:5:27 When he has made her drink the water, then it shall happen, if she is defiled, and has committed a trespass against her husband, that the water that causes the curse will enter into her and become bitter, and her body will swell, and her thigh will fall away: and the woman will be a curse among her people. 
verse:5:28 If the woman isn't defiled, but is clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.
verse:5:29 "'This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband, goes astray, and is defiled; 
verse:5:30 or when the spirit of jealousy comes on a man, and he is jealous of his wife; then he shall set the woman before HASHEM, and the priest shall execute on her all this law. 
verse:5:31 The man shall be free from iniquity, and that woman shall bear her iniquity.'"
verse:6:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:6:2 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them: 'When either man or woman shall make a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself to HASHEM, 
verse:6:3 he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink. He shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of fermented drink, neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried. 
verse:6:4 All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is made of the grapevine, from the seeds even to the skins.
verse:6:5 "'All the days of his vow of separation no razor shall come on his head, until the days are fulfilled, in which he separates himself to HASHEM. He shall be holy. He shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.
verse:6:6 "'All the days that he separates himself to HASHEM he shall not go near a dead body. 
verse:6:7 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; because his separation to God is on his head. 
verse:6:8 All the days of his separation he is holy to HASHEM.
verse:6:9 "'If any man dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles the head of his separation; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing. On the seventh day he shall shave it. 
verse:6:10 On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:6:11 The priest shall offer one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, because he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall make his head holy that same day. 
verse:6:12 He shall separate to HASHEM the days of his separation, and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a trespass offering; but the former days shall be void, because his separation was defiled.
verse:6:13 "'This is the law of the Nazirite: when the days of his separation are fulfilled, he shall be brought to the door of the Tent of Meeting, 
verse:6:14 and he shall offer his offering to HASHEM, one male lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings, 
verse:6:15 and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal offering, and their drink offerings. 
verse:6:16 The priest shall present them before HASHEM, and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering. 
verse:6:17 He shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to HASHEM, with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest shall offer also its meal offering, and its drink offering. 
verse:6:18 The Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings. 
verse:6:19 The priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite, after he has shaved the head of his separation; 
verse:6:20 and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before HASHEM. This is holy for the priest, together with the breast that is waved and the thigh that is offered. After that the Nazirite may drink wine.
verse:6:21 "'This is the law of the Nazirite who vows, and of his offering to HASHEM for his separation, besides that which he is able to get. According to his vow which he vows, so he must do after the law of his separation.'"
verse:6:22 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:6:23 "Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'This is how you shall bless the children of Israel.' You shall tell them, 
verse:6:24 'HASHEM bless you, and keep you. 
verse:6:25 HASHEM make his face to shine on you, and be gracious to you. 
verse:6:26 HASHEM lift up his face toward you, and give you peace.'
verse:6:27 "So they shall put my name on the children of Israel; and I will bless them."
verse:7:1 It happened on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, with all its furniture, and the altar with all its vessels, and had anointed and sanctified them; 
verse:7:2 that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers' houses, offered. These were the princes of the tribes. These are they who were over those who were numbered: 
verse:7:3 and they brought their offering before HASHEM, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they presented them before the tabernacle. 
verse:7:4 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:7:5 "Accept these from them, that they may be used in doing the service of the Tent of Meeting; and you shall give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service."
verse:7:6 Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites. 
verse:7:7 He gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, according to their service: 
verse:7:8 and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 
verse:7:9 But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the sanctuary belonged to them; they carried it on their shoulders.
verse:7:10 The princes gave offerings for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes gave their offerings before the altar.
verse:7:11 HASHEM said to Moses, "They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedication of the altar."

verse:7:89 When Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with HASHEM, he heard his voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the Testimony, from between the two cherubim: and he spoke to him.
portion:Numbers 8:1 - 12:16
verse:8:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:8:2 "Speak to Aaron, and tell him, 'When you light the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the menorah.'"
verse:8:3 Aaron did so. He lit its lamps to light the area in front of the menorah, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:8:4 This was the workmanship of the menorah, beaten work of gold. From its base to its flowers, it was beaten work: according to the pattern which HASHEM had shown Moses, so he made the menorah.
verse:8:5 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:8:6 "Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. 
verse:8:7 You shall do this to them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of cleansing on them, let them shave their whole bodies with a razor, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves. 
verse:8:8 Then let them take a young bull, and its meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and another young bull you shall take for a sin offering. 
verse:8:9 You shall present the Levites before the Tent of Meeting. You shall assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel. 
verse:8:10 You shall present the Levites before HASHEM. The children of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites, 
verse:8:11 and Aaron shall offer the Levites before HASHEM for a wave offering, on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of HASHEM.
verse:8:12 "The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering to HASHEM, to make atonement for the Levites. 
verse:8:13 You shall set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them as a wave offering to HASHEM. 
verse:8:14 Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine.
verse:8:15 "After that, the Levites shall go in to do the service of the Tent of Meeting: and you shall cleanse them, and offer them as a wave offering. 
verse:8:16 For they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel; instead of all who open the womb, even the firstborn of all the children of Israel, I have taken them to me. 
verse:8:17 For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine, both man and animal. On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for myself. 
verse:8:18 I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel. 
verse:8:19 I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the Tent of Meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come near to the sanctuary."
verse:8:20 Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel did so to the Levites. According to all that HASHEM commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the children of Israel did to them. 
verse:8:21 The Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering before HASHEM; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them. 
verse:8:22 After that, the Levites went in to do their service in the Tent of Meeting before Aaron, and before his sons: as HASHEM had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.
verse:8:23 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:8:24 "This is that which belongs to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service in the work of the Tent of Meeting; 
verse:8:25 and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting on the work, and shall serve no more, 
verse:8:26 but shall minister with their brothers in the Tent of Meeting, to perform the duty, and shall do no service. You shall do thus to the Levites concerning their duties."
verse:9:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying, 
verse:9:2 "Moreover let the children of Israel keep the Passover in its appointed season. 
verse:9:3 On the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, you shall keep it in its appointed season--according to all its statutes, and according to all its ordinances, you shall keep it."
verse:9:4 Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should keep the Passover. 
verse:9:5 They kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai. According to all that HASHEM commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did. 
verse:9:6 There were certain men, who were unclean because of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day. 
verse:9:7 Those men said to him, "We are unclean because of the dead body of a man. Why are we kept back, that we may not offer the offering of HASHEM in its appointed season among the children of Israel?"
verse:9:8 Moses answered them, "Wait, that I may hear what HASHEM will command concerning you."
verse:9:9 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:9:10 "Say to the children of Israel, 'If any man of you or of your generations is unclean by reason of a dead body, or is on a journey far away, he shall still keep the Passover to HASHEM. 
verse:9:11 In the second month, on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 
verse:9:12 They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it. According to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it. 
verse:9:13 But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails to keep the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people. Because he didn't offer the offering of HASHEM in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
verse:9:14 "'If a foreigner lives among you, and desires to keep the Passover to HASHEM; according to the statute of the Passover, and according to its ordinance, so shall he do. You shall have one statute, both for the foreigner, and for him who is born in the land.'"
verse:9:15 On the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the Tent of the Testimony: and at evening it was over the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning. 
verse:9:16 So it was continually. The cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night. 
verse:9:17 Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel traveled; and in the place where the cloud remained, there the children of Israel encamped. 
verse:9:18 At the commandment of HASHEM, the children of Israel traveled, and at the commandment of HASHEM they encamped. As long as the cloud remained on the tabernacle they remained encamped. 
verse:9:19 When the cloud stayed on the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept HASHEM's command, and didn't travel. 
verse:9:20 Sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of HASHEM they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of HASHEM they traveled. 
verse:9:21 Sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they traveled: or by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they traveled. 
verse:9:22 Whether it was two days, or a month, or a year that the cloud stayed on the tabernacle, remaining on it, the children of Israel remained encamped, and didn't travel; but when it was taken up, they traveled. 
verse:9:23 At the commandment of HASHEM they encamped, and at the commandment of HASHEM they traveled. They kept HASHEM's command, at the commandment of HASHEM by Moses.
verse:10:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:10:2 "Make two shofars of silver. You shall make them of beaten work. You shall use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps. 
verse:10:3 When they blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:10:4 If they blow just one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to you. 
verse:10:5 When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall go forward. 
verse:10:6 When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys. 
verse:10:7 But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.
verse:10:8 "The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the shofars. This shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations. 
verse:10:9 When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the shofars. Then you will be remembered before HASHEM your God, and you will be saved from your enemies.
verse:10:10 "Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the shofars over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God. I am HASHEM your God."
verse:10:11 It happened in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony. 
verse:10:12 The children of Israel went forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran. 
verse:10:13 They first went forward according to the commandment of HASHEM by Moses.
verse:10:14 First, the standard of the camp of the children of Judah went forward according to their armies. Nahshon the son of Amminadab was over his army. 
verse:10:15 Nethanel the son of Zuar was over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar. 
verse:10:16 Eliab the son of Helon was over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun. 
verse:10:17 The tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bore the tabernacle, went forward. 
verse:10:18 The standard of the camp of Reuben went forward according to their armies. Elizur the son of Shedeur was over his army. 
verse:10:19 Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai was over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon. 
verse:10:20 Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad.
verse:10:21 The Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary. The others set up the tabernacle before they arrived.
verse:10:22 The standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies. Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army. 
verse:10:23 Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur was over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh. 
verse:10:24 Abidan the son of Gideoni was over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin.
verse:10:25 The standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rear guard of all the camps, set forward according to their armies. Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai was over his army. 
verse:10:26 Pagiel the son of Ochran was over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher. 
verse:10:27 Ahira the son of Enan was over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali. 
verse:10:28 Thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies; and they went forward.
verse:10:29 Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, "We are journeying to the place of which HASHEM said, 'I will give it to you.' Come with us, and we will treat you well; for HASHEM has spoken good concerning Israel."
verse:10:30 He said to him, "I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my relatives."
verse:10:31 He said, "Don't leave us, please; because you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes. 
verse:10:32 It shall be, if you go with us, yes, it shall be, that whatever good HASHEM does to us, we will do the same to you."
verse:10:33 They set forward from the Mount of HASHEM three days' journey. The ark of the covenant of HASHEM went before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting place for them. 
verse:10:34 The cloud of HASHEM was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp. 
verse:10:35 It happened, when the ark went forward, that Moses said, "Rise up, HASHEM, and let your enemies be scattered! Let those who hate you flee before you!" 
verse:10:36 When it rested, he said, "Return, HASHEM, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel."
verse:11:1 The people were complaining in the ears of HASHEM. When HASHEM heard it, his anger was kindled; and HASHEM's fire burnt among them, and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp. 
verse:11:2 The people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to HASHEM, and the fire abated. 
verse:11:3 The name of that place was called Taberah, because HASHEM's fire burnt among them.
verse:11:4 The mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, "Who will give us flesh to eat? 
verse:11:5 We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic; 
verse:11:6 but now we have lost our appetite. There is nothing at all except this manna to look at." 
verse:11:7 The manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium. 
verse:11:8 The people went around, gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it. Its taste was like the taste of fresh oil. 
verse:11:9 When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.
verse:11:10 Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and the anger of HASHEM was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased. 
verse:11:11 Moses said to HASHEM, "Why have you treated with your servant so badly? Why haven't I found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me? 
verse:11:12 Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them forth, that you should tell me, 'Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you swore to their fathers?' 
verse:11:13 Where could I get meat to give to all this people? For they weep to me, saying, 'Give us meat, that we may eat.' 
verse:11:14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me. 
verse:11:15 If you treat me this way, please kill me right now, if I have found favor in your sight; and don't let me see my wretchedness."
verse:11:16 HASHEM said to Moses, "Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you. 
verse:11:17 I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you not bear it yourself alone.
verse:11:18 "Say to the people, 'Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and you will eat flesh; for you have wept in the ears of HASHEM, saying, "Who will give us flesh to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt." Therefore HASHEM will give you flesh, and you will eat. 
verse:11:19 You will not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days, 
verse:11:20 but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it is loathsome to you; because that you have rejected HASHEM who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, "Why did we come out of Egypt?"'"
verse:11:21 Moses said, "The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand men on foot; and you have said, 'I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.' 
verse:11:22 Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?"
verse:11:23 HASHEM said to Moses, "Has HASHEM's hand grown short? Now you will see whether my word will happen to you or not."
verse:11:24 Moses went out, and told the people the words of HASHEM; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the Tent. 
verse:11:25 HASHEM came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders: and it happened that when the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did so no more. 
verse:11:26 But two men remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested on them; and they were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp. 
verse:11:27 A young man ran, and told Moses, and said, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!"
verse:11:28 Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered, "My lord Moses, forbid them!"
verse:11:29 Moses said to him, "Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all HASHEM's people were prophets, that HASHEM would put his Spirit on them!"
verse:11:30 Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. 
verse:11:31 A wind from HASHEM went out and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the earth. 
verse:11:32 The people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten omers; and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp. 
verse:11:33 While the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of HASHEM was kindled against the people, and HASHEM struck the people with a very great plague. 
verse:11:34 The name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.
verse:11:35 From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth; and they stayed at Hazeroth.
verse:12:1 Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman. 
verse:12:2 They said, "Has HASHEM indeed spoken only with Moses? Hasn't he spoken also with us?" And HASHEM heard it.
verse:12:3 Now the man Moses was very humble, above all the men who were on the surface of the earth. 
verse:12:4 HASHEM spoke suddenly to Moses, to Aaron, and to Miriam, "You three come out to the Tent of Meeting!"
The three of them came out. 
verse:12:5 HASHEM came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward. 
verse:12:6 He said, "Hear now my words. If there is a prophet among you, I HASHEM will make myself known to him in a vision. I will speak with him in a dream. 
verse:12:7 My servant Moses is not so. He is faithful in all my house. 
verse:12:8 With him I will speak mouth to mouth, even plainly, and not in riddles; and he shall see HASHEM's form. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?" 
verse:12:9 The anger of HASHEM was kindled against them; and he departed. 
verse:12:10 The cloud departed from over the Tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. Aaron looked at Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.
verse:12:11 Aaron said to Moses, "Oh, my lord, please don't count this sin against us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned. 
verse:12:12 Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb."
verse:12:13 Moses cried to HASHEM, saying, "Heal her, God, I beg you!"
verse:12:14 HASHEM said to Moses, "If her father had but spit in her face, shouldn't she be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut up outside of the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again."
verse:12:15 Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days, and the people didn't travel until Miriam was brought in again. 
verse:12:16 Afterward the people traveled from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.
portion:Numbers 13:1 - 15:41
verse:13:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:13:2 "Send men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel. Of every tribe of their fathers, you shall send a man, every one a prince among them."
verse:13:3 Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of HASHEM: all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel. 
verse:13:4 These were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur. 
verse:13:5 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. 
verse:13:6 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 
verse:13:7 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph. 
verse:13:8 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun. 
verse:13:9 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. 
verse:13:10 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi. 
verse:13:11 Of the tribe of Joseph, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi. 
verse:13:12 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. 
verse:13:13 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. 
verse:13:14 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. 
verse:13:15 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. 
verse:13:16 These are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land. Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua. 
verse:13:17 Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, "Go up this way by the South, and go up into the hill country: 
verse:13:18 and see the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many; 
verse:13:19 and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds; 
verse:13:20 and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. Be courageous, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes." 
verse:13:21 So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath. 
verse:13:22 They went up by the South, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
verse:13:23 They came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it on a staff between two. They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs. 
verse:13:24 That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there. 
verse:13:25 They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days. 
verse:13:26 They went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. 
verse:13:27 They told him, and said, "We came to the land where you sent us; and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this is its fruit. 
verse:13:28 However the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw the children of Anak there. 
verse:13:29 Amalek dwells in the land of the South: and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill country; and the Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan." 
verse:13:30 Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, "Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it." 
verse:13:31 But the men who went up with him said, "We aren't able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we." 
verse:13:32 They brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the children of Israel, saying, "The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw in it are men of great stature. 
verse:13:33 There we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight."
verse:14:1 All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. 
verse:14:2 All the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said to them, "Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would that we had died in this wilderness! 
verse:14:3 Why does HASHEM bring us to this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be a prey: wouldn't it be better for us to return into Egypt?" 
verse:14:4 They said one to another, "Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt." 
verse:14:5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. 
verse:14:6 Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes: 
verse:14:7 and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, "The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land. 
verse:14:8 If HASHEM delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which flows with milk and honey. 
verse:14:9 Only don't rebel against HASHEM, neither fear the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is removed from over them, and HASHEM is with us. Don't fear them." 
verse:14:10 But all the congregation threatened to stone them with stones. The glory of HASHEM appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel. 
verse:14:11 HASHEM said to Moses, "How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have worked among them? 
verse:14:12 I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they." 
verse:14:13 Moses said to HASHEM, "Then the Egyptians will hear it; for you brought up this people in your might from among them; 
verse:14:14 and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you HASHEM are in the midst of this people; for you HASHEM are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night. 
verse:14:15 Now if you killed this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying, 
verse:14:16 'Because HASHEM was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.' 
verse:14:17 Now please let the power of my Lord be great, according as you have spoken, saying, 
verse:14:18 'HASHEM is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, forgiving iniquity and disobedience; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation.' 
verse:14:19 Please pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving kindness, and according as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now." 
verse:14:20 HASHEM said, "I have pardoned according to your word: 
verse:14:21 but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of HASHEM; 
verse:14:22 because all those men who have seen my glory, and my signs, which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not listened to my voice; 
verse:14:23 surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of those who despised me see it: 
verse:14:24 but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land into which he went; and his seed shall possess it. 
verse:14:25 Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley: tomorrow turn, and go into the wilderness by the way to the Sea of Suf." 
verse:14:26 HASHEM spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
verse:14:27 "How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, that murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me. 
verse:14:28 Tell them, 'As I live, says HASHEM, surely as you have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you: 
verse:14:29 your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all who were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me, 
verse:14:30 surely you shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. 
verse:14:31 But your little ones, that you said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which you have rejected. 
verse:14:32 But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness. 
verse:14:33 Your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your prostitution, until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness. 
verse:14:34 After the number of the days in which you spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, you will bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you will know my alienation.' 
verse:14:35 I, HASHEM, have spoken, surely this will I do to all this evil congregation, who are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die." 
verse:14:36 The men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land, 
verse:14:37 even those men who brought up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before HASHEM. 
verse:14:38 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land. 
verse:14:39 Moses told these words to all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly. 
verse:14:40 They rose up early in the morning, and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, "Behold, we are here, and will go up to the place which HASHEM has promised: for we have sinned." 
verse:14:41 Moses said, "Why now do you disobey the commandment of HASHEM, since it shall not prosper? 
verse:14:42 Don't go up, for HASHEM isn't among you; that you not be struck down before your enemies. 
verse:14:43 For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and you shall fall by the sword: because you are turned back from following HASHEM, therefore HASHEM will not be with you."
verse:14:44 But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of HASHEM, and Moses, didn't depart out of the camp. 
verse:14:45 Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite who lived in that mountain, and struck them and beat them down, even to Hormah.
verse:15:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:15:2 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you have come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you, 
verse:15:3 and will make an offering by fire to HASHEM, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a freewill offering, or in your set feasts, to make a pleasant aroma to HASHEM, of the herd, or of the flock; 
verse:15:4 then he who offers his offering shall offer to HASHEM a meal offering of a tenth part of an efah of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of oil: 
verse:15:5 and wine for the drink offering, the fourth part of a hin, you shall prepare with the burnt offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.
verse:15:6 "'Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenth parts of an efah of fine flour mixed with the third part of a hin of oil: 
verse:15:7 and for the drink offering you shall offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a pleasant aroma to HASHEM. 
verse:15:8 When you prepare a bull for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings to HASHEM; 
verse:15:9 then shall he offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenth parts of an efah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil: 
verse:15:10 and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to HASHEM. 
verse:15:11 Thus shall it be done for each bull, or for each ram, or for each of the male lambs, or of the young goats. 
verse:15:12 According to the number that you shall prepare, so you shall do to everyone according to their number.
verse:15:13 "'All who are native-born shall do these things in this way, in offering an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to HASHEM. 
verse:15:14 If a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, or whoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to HASHEM; as you do, so he shall do. 
verse:15:15 For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner, a statute forever throughout your generations: as you are, so shall the foreigner be before HASHEM. 
verse:15:16 One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner with you.'"
verse:15:17 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:15:18 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you come into the land where I bring you, 
verse:15:19 then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up a wave offering to HASHEM. 
verse:15:20 Of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a wave offering: as the wave offering of the threshing floor, so you shall heave it. 
verse:15:21 Of the first of your dough you shall give to HASHEM a wave offering throughout your generations.
verse:15:22 "'When you shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which HASHEM has spoken to Moses, 
verse:15:23 even all that HASHEM has commanded you by Moses, from the day that HASHEM gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations; 
verse:15:24 then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt offering, for a pleasant aroma to HASHEM, with the meal offering of it, and the drink offering of it, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering. 
verse:15:25 The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire to HASHEM, and their sin offering before HASHEM, for their error: 
verse:15:26 and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them; for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly.
verse:15:27 "'If one person sins unwittingly, then he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering. 
verse:15:28 The priest shall make atonement for the soul who errs, when he sins unwittingly, before HASHEM, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven. 
verse:15:29 You shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly, for him who is native-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them.
verse:15:30 "'But the soul who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native-born or a foreigner, the same blasphemes HASHEM; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
verse:15:31 Because he has despised the word of HASHEM, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be on him.'"
verse:15:32 While the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day. 
verse:15:33 Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation. 
verse:15:34 They put him in custody, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.
verse:15:35 HASHEM said to Moses, "The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside of the camp." 
verse:15:36 All the congregation brought him outside of the camp, and stoned him to death with stones; as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:15:37 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:15:38 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them that they should make themselves tzitzit in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the tzitzit of each border a cord of blue: 
verse:15:39 and it shall be to you for a tzitzit, that you may look on it, and remember all the commandments of HASHEM, and do them; and that you not follow after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you use to play the prostitute; 
verse:15:40 that you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God. 
verse:15:41 I am HASHEM your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am HASHEM your God."
portion:Numbers 16:1 - 18:32
verse:16:1 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men: 
verse:16:2 and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown; 
verse:16:3 and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, "You take too much on yourself, since all the congregation are holy, everyone of them, and HASHEM is among them: why then lift yourselves up above the assembly of HASHEM?"
verse:16:4 When Moses heard it, he fell on his face: 
verse:16:5 and he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, "In the morning HASHEM will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to him: even him whom he shall choose he will cause to come near to him. 
verse:16:6 Do this: take censers, Korah, and all his company; 
verse:16:7 and put fire in them, and put incense on them before HASHEM tomorrow: and it shall be that the man whom HASHEM chooses, he shall be holy. You have gone too far, you sons of Levi!"
verse:16:8 Moses said to Korah, "Hear now, you sons of Levi! 
verse:16:9 Is it a small thing to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of HASHEM, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them; 
verse:16:10 and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? and do you seek the priesthood also? 
verse:16:11 Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against HASHEM: and Aaron, what is he that you murmur against him?"
verse:16:12 Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, "We won't come up: 
verse:16:13 is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a prince over us? 
verse:16:14 Moreover you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: will you put out the eyes of these men? We won't come up." 
verse:16:15 Moses was very angry, and said to HASHEM, "Don't respect their offering: I have not taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them." 
verse:16:16 Moses said to Korah, "You and all your company go before HASHEM, you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow: 
verse:16:17 and each man take his censer, and put incense on them, and each man bring before HASHEM his censer, two hundred fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer." 
verse:16:18 They each took his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron. 
verse:16:19 Korah assembled all the congregation against them to the door of the Tent of Meeting: and the glory of HASHEM appeared to all the congregation. 
verse:16:20 HASHEM spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
verse:16:21 "Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!" 
verse:16:22 They fell on their faces, and said, "God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?"
verse:16:23 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:16:24 "Speak to the congregation, saying, 'Get away from around the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram!'" 
verse:16:25 Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him. 
verse:16:26 He spoke to the congregation, saying, "Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins!"
verse:16:27 So they went away from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones. 
verse:16:28 Moses said, "Hereby you shall know that HASHEM has sent me to do all these works; for they are not from my own mind. 
verse:16:29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then HASHEM hasn't sent me. 
verse:16:30 But if HASHEM make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain to them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then you shall understand that these men have despised HASHEM."
verse:16:31 It happened, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground split apart that was under them; 
verse:16:32 and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men who appertained to Korah, and all their goods. 
verse:16:33 So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed on them, and they perished from among the assembly. 
verse:16:34 All Israel that were around them fled at their cry; for they said, "Lest the earth swallow us up!" 
verse:16:35 Fire came forth from HASHEM, and devoured the two hundred fifty men who offered the incense.
verse:17:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:17:2 "Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter the fire yonder; for they are holy, 
verse:17:3 even the censers of these sinners against their own lives; and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before HASHEM; therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel." 
verse:17:4 Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar, 
verse:17:5 to be a memorial to the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger, who isn't of the seed of Aaron, comes near to burn incense before HASHEM; that he not be as Korah, and as his company: as HASHEM spoke to him by Moses. 
verse:17:6 But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, "You have killed HASHEM's people!" 
verse:17:7 It happened, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the Tent of Meeting: and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of HASHEM appeared. 
verse:17:8 Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:17:9 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:17:10 "Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!" They fell on their faces.
verse:17:11 Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer, and put fire from off the altar in it, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from HASHEM! The plague has begun."
verse:17:12 Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and behold, the plague has begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people. 
verse:17:13 He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. 
verse:17:14 Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those who died about the matter of Korah. 
verse:17:15 Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the Tent of Meeting: and the plague was stayed.
verse:17:16 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:17:17 "Speak to the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers' house, of all their princes according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods: write every man's name on his rod. 
verse:17:18 You shall write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers' houses. 
verse:17:19 You shall lay them up in the Tent of Meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you. 
verse:17:20 It shall happen, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you."
verse:17:21 Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods. 
verse:17:22 Moses laid up the rods before HASHEM in the tent of the testimony.
verse:17:23 It happened on the next day, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds. 
verse:17:24 Moses brought out all the rods from before HASHEM to all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.
verse:17:25 HASHEM said to Moses, "Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that you may make an end of their murmurings against me, that they not die." 
verse:17:26 Moses did so. As HASHEM commanded him, so he did.
verse:17:27 The children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, "Behold, we perish! We are undone! We are all undone! 
verse:17:28 Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of HASHEM, dies! Will we all perish?"
verse:18:1 HASHEM said to Aaron, "You and your sons and your fathers' house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood. 
verse:18:2 Your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, bring near with you, that they may be joined to you, and minister to you: but you and your sons with you shall be before the tent of the testimony. 
verse:18:3 They shall keep your commands, and the duty of all the Tent: only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar, that they not die, neither they, nor you. 
verse:18:4 They shall be joined to you, and keep the responsibility of the Tent of Meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger shall not come near to you.
verse:18:5 "You shall perform the duty of the sanctuary, and the duty of the altar; that there be no more wrath on the children of Israel. 
verse:18:6 I, behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift, given to HASHEM, to do the service of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:18:7 You and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and you shall serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger who comes near shall be put to death."
verse:18:8 HASHEM spoke to Aaron, "I, behold, I have given you the command of my wave offerings, even all the holy things of the children of Israel; to you have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, as a portion forever. 
verse:18:9 This shall be yours of the most holy things from the fire: every offering of theirs, even every meal offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons. 
verse:18:10 You shall eat of it like the most holy things. Every male shall eat of it. It shall be holy to you.
verse:18:11 "This is yours, too: the wave offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the children of Israel. I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, as a portion forever. Everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it.
verse:18:12 "All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first fruits of them which they give to HASHEM, to you have I given them. 
verse:18:13 The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to HASHEM, shall be yours; everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it.
verse:18:14 "Everything devoted in Israel shall be yours. 
verse:18:15 Everything that opens the womb, of all flesh which they offer to HASHEM, both of man and animal shall be yours: nevertheless you shall surely redeem the firstborn of man, and you shall redeem the firstborn of unclean animals. 
verse:18:16 You shall redeem those who are to be redeemed of them from a month old, according to your estimation, for five shekels of money, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs).
verse:18:17 "But you shall not redeem the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat. They are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a pleasant aroma to HASHEM. 
verse:18:18 Their flesh shall be yours, as the wave offering breast and as the right thigh, it shall be yours. 
verse:18:19 All the wave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to HASHEM, have I given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, as a portion forever: it is a covenant of salt forever before HASHEM to you and to your seed with you."
verse:18:20 HASHEM said to Aaron, "You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any portion among them. I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel.
verse:18:21 "To the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:18:22 Henceforth the children of Israel shall not come near the Tent of Meeting, lest they bear sin, and die. 
verse:18:23 But the Levites shall do the service of the Tent of Meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. 
verse:18:24 For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a wave offering to HASHEM, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said to them, 'Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.'"
verse:18:25 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:18:26 "Moreover you shall speak to the Levites, and tell them, 'When you take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall offer up a wave offering of it for HASHEM, a tithe of the tithe. 
verse:18:27 Your wave offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it were the grain of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the winepress. 
verse:18:28 Thus you also shall offer a wave offering to HASHEM of all your tithes, which you receive of the children of Israel; and of it you shall give HASHEM's wave offering to Aaron the priest. 
verse:18:29 Out of all your gifts you shall offer every wave offering of HASHEM, of all its best, even the holy part of it out of it.'
verse:18:30 "Therefore you shall tell them, 'When you heave its best from it, then it shall be reckoned to the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the winepress. 
verse:18:31 You shall eat it in every place, you and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:18:32 You shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved from it its best: and you shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that you not die.'"
portion:Numbers 19:1 - 22:1
verse:19:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
verse:19:2 "This is the statute of the law which HASHEM has commanded: Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring you a red heifer without spot, in which is no blemish, and which was never yoked. 
verse:19:3 You shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth outside of the camp, and one shall kill her before his face: 
verse:19:4 and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the Tent of Meeting seven times. 
verse:19:5 One shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn: 
verse:19:6 and the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer. 
verse:19:7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening. 
verse:19:8 He who burns her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.
verse:19:9 "A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up outside of the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water for impurity: it is a sin offering. 
verse:19:10 He who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: and it shall be to the children of Israel, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them, for a statute forever.
verse:19:11 "He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days: 
verse:19:12 the same shall purify himself with water on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he doesn't purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean. 
verse:19:13 Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a man who has died, and doesn't purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of HASHEM; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet on him.
verse:19:14 "This is the law when a man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. 
verse:19:15 Every open vessel, which has no covering bound on it, is unclean.
verse:19:16 "Whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
verse:19:17 "For the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin offering; and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel: 
verse:19:18 and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, and on all the vessels, and on the persons who were there, and on him who touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave: 
verse:19:19 and the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify him; and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at evening. 
verse:19:20 But the man who shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of HASHEM: the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean. 
verse:19:21 It shall be a perpetual statute to them: and he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening.
verse:19:22 "Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the soul that touches it shall be unclean until evening."
verse:20:1 The children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month: and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. 
verse:20:2 There was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. 
verse:20:3 The people strove with Moses, and spoke, saying, "We wish that we had died when our brothers died before HASHEM! 
verse:20:4 Why have you brought the assembly of HASHEM into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our animals? 
verse:20:5 Why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink."
verse:20:6 Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and fell on their faces: and the glory of HASHEM appeared to them. 
verse:20:7 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:20:8 "Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and you shall bring forth to them water out of the rock; so you shall give the congregation and their livestock drink."
verse:20:9 Moses took the rod from before HASHEM, as he commanded him. 
verse:20:10 Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, "Hear now, you rebels; shall we bring you water out of this rock for you?" 
verse:20:11 Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their livestock.
verse:20:12 HASHEM said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you didn't believe in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them."
verse:20:13 These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with HASHEM, and he was sanctified in them. 
verse:20:14 Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying:
"Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the travail that has happened to us: 
verse:20:15 how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and our fathers: 
verse:20:16 and when we cried to HASHEM, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt: and behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of your border.
verse:20:17 "Please let us pass through your land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go along the king's highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your border."
verse:20:18 Edom said to him, "You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against you."
verse:20:19 The children of Israel said to him, "We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of your water, I and my livestock, then will I give its price: let me only, without doing anything else, pass through on my feet."
verse:20:20 He said, "You shall not pass through." Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand. 
verse:20:21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border, so Israel turned away from him.
verse:20:22 They traveled from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor. 
verse:20:23 HASHEM spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying, 
verse:20:24 "Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah. 
verse:20:25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor; 
verse:20:26 and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be taken, and shall die there."
verse:20:27 Moses did as HASHEM commanded: and they went up into Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. 
verse:20:28 Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. 
verse:20:29 When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
verse:21:1 The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive. 
verse:21:2 Israel vowed a vow to HASHEM, and said, "If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities." 
verse:21:3 HASHEM listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and the name of the place was called Hormah.
verse:21:4 They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Sea of Suf, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. 
verse:21:5 The people spoke against God, and against Moses, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loathes this light bread."
verse:21:6 HASHEM sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many people of Israel died. 
verse:21:7 The people came to Moses, and said, "We have sinned, because we have spoken against HASHEM, and against you. Pray to HASHEM, that he take away the serpents from us." Moses prayed for the people.
verse:21:8 HASHEM said to Moses, "Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a standard: and it shall happen, that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live." 
verse:21:9 Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it on the standard: and it happened, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked to the serpent of brass, he lived. 
verse:21:10 The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in Oboth. 
verse:21:11 They traveled from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise. 
verse:21:12 From there they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered. 
verse:21:13 From there they traveled, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that comes out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 
verse:21:14 Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of HASHEM, "Vaheb in Suphah, the valleys of the Arnon, 
verse:21:15 the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moab."
verse:21:16 From there they traveled to Beer: that is the well of which HASHEM said to Moses, "Gather the people together, and I will give them water."
verse:21:17 Then sang Israel this song: "Spring up, well; sing to it: 
verse:21:18 the well, which the princes dug, which the nobles of the people dug, with the scepter, and with their poles." 
From the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah; 
verse:21:19 and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth; 
verse:21:20 and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert. 
verse:21:21 Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, 
verse:21:22 "Let me pass through your land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's highway, until we have passed your border."
verse:21:23 Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel. 
verse:21:24 Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. 
verse:21:25 Israel took all these cities: and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its towns. 
verse:21:26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon. 
verse:21:27 Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, "Come to Heshbon. Let the city of Sihon be built and established; 
verse:21:28 for a fire has gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It has devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of the Arnon. 
verse:21:29 Woe to you, Moab! You are undone, people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites. 
verse:21:30 We have shot at them. Heshbon has perished even to Dibon. We have laid waste even to Nophah, Which reaches to Medeba."
verse:21:31 Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites. 
verse:21:32 Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took its towns, and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
verse:21:33 They turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
verse:21:34 HASHEM said to Moses, "Don't fear him: for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people, and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon."
verse:21:35 So they struck him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land.
verse:22:1 The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho. 
portion:Numbers 22:2 - 25:9
verse:22:2 Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. 
verse:22:3 Moab was very afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel. 
verse:22:4 Moab said to the elders of Midian, "Now this multitude will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field."
Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. 
verse:22:5 He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, "Behold, there is a people who came out from Egypt. Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they are staying opposite me. 
verse:22:6 Please come now therefore curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed."
verse:22:7 The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak. 
verse:22:8 He said to them, "Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as HASHEM shall speak to me." The princes of Moab stayed with Balaam. 
verse:22:9 God came to Balaam, and said, "Who are these men with you?" 
verse:22:10 Balaam said to God, "Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has said to me, 
verse:22:11 'Behold, the people that has come out of Egypt, it covers the surface of the earth: now, come curse me them; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.'"
verse:22:12 God said to Balaam, "You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people; for they are blessed."
verse:22:13 Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, "Go to your land; for HASHEM refuses to permit me to go with you."
verse:22:14 The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, "Balaam refuses to come with us."
verse:22:15 Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they. 
verse:22:16 They came to Balaam, and said to him, "Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, 'Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me: 
verse:22:17 for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.'"
verse:22:18 Balaam answered the servants of Balak, "If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word of HASHEM my God, to do less or more. 
verse:22:19 Now therefore, please wait also here this night, that I may know what HASHEM will speak to me more."
verse:22:20 God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, "If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do."
verse:22:21 Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab. 
verse:22:22 God's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of HASHEM placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him. 
verse:22:23 The donkey saw the angel of HASHEM standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the way. 
verse:22:24 Then the angel of HASHEM stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side. 
verse:22:25 The donkey saw the angel of HASHEM, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he struck her again.
verse:22:26 The angel of HASHEM went further, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. 
verse:22:27 The donkey saw the angel of HASHEM, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.
verse:22:28 HASHEM opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?"
verse:22:29 Balaam said to the donkey, "Because you have mocked me, I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you."
verse:22:30 The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to you?"
He said, "No."
verse:22:31 Then HASHEM opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of HASHEM standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face. 
verse:22:32 The angel of HASHEM said to him, "Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come forth as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me: 
verse:22:33 and the donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times. Unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved her alive."
verse:22:34 Balaam said to the angel of HASHEM, "I have sinned; for I didn't know that you stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases you, I will go back again."
verse:22:35 The angel of HASHEM said to Balaam, "Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak."
So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. 
verse:22:36 When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border. 
verse:22:37 Balak said to Balaam, "Didn't I earnestly send to you to call you? Why didn't you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?"
verse:22:38 Balaam said to Balak, "Behold, I have come to you: have I now any power at all to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak."
verse:22:39 Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth. 
verse:22:40 Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who were with him. 
verse:22:41 It happened in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there the utmost part of the people.
verse:23:1 Balaam said to Balak, "Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams."
verse:23:2 Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram. 
verse:23:3 Balaam said to Balak, "Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go: perhaps HASHEM will come to meet me; and whatever he shows me I will tell you."
He went to a bare height. 
verse:23:4 God met Balaam: and he said to him, "I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar."
verse:23:5 HASHEM put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak."
verse:23:6 He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab. 
verse:23:7 He took up his parable, and said, "From Aram has Balak brought me, the king of Moab from the mountains of the East. Come, curse Jacob for me. Come, defy Israel. 
verse:23:8 How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? How shall I defy whom HASHEM has not defied? 
verse:23:9 For from the top of the rocks I see him. From the hills I see him. Behold, it is a people that dwells alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations. 
verse:23:10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous! Let my last end be like his!"
verse:23:11 Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them altogether."
verse:23:12 He answered and said, "Must I not take heed to speak that which HASHEM puts in my mouth?"
verse:23:13 Balak said to him, "Please come with me to another place, where you may see them; you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them from there."
verse:23:14 He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar. 
verse:23:15 He said to Balak, "Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet over there."
verse:23:16 HASHEM met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and say this."
verse:23:17 He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. Balak said to him, "What has HASHEM spoken?"
verse:23:18 He took up his parable, and said, "Rise up, Balak, and hear! Listen to me, you son of Zippor. 
verse:23:19 God is not a man, that he should lie, nor the son of man, that he should repent. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good? 
verse:23:20 Behold, I have received a command to bless. He has blessed, and I can't reverse it. 
verse:23:21 He has not seen iniquity in Jacob. Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel. HASHEM his God is with him. The shout of a king is among them. 
verse:23:22 God brings them out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of the wild ox. 
verse:23:23 Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there any divination with Israel. Now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God done! 
verse:23:24 Behold, the people rises up as a lioness, As a lion he lifts himself up. He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drinks the blood of the slain."
verse:23:25 Balak said to Balaam, "Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all."
verse:23:26 But Balaam answered Balak, "Didn't I tell you, saying, 'All that HASHEM speaks, that I must do?'"
verse:23:27 Balak said to Balaam, "Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse me them from there."
verse:23:28 Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down on the desert. 
verse:23:29 Balaam said to Balak, "Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams."
verse:23:30 Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.
verse:24:1 When Balaam saw that it pleased HASHEM to bless Israel, he didn't go, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness. 
verse:24:2 Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him. 
verse:24:3 He took up his parable, and said, "Balaam the son of Beor says, the man whose eye was closed says; 
verse:24:4 he says, who hears the words of God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, and having his eyes open: 
verse:24:5 How goodly are your tents, Jacob, and your tents, Israel! 
verse:24:6 As valleys they are spread forth, as gardens by the riverside, as aloes which HASHEM has planted, as cedar trees beside the waters. 
verse:24:7 Water shall flow from his buckets. His seed shall be in many waters. His king shall be higher than Agag. His kingdom shall be exalted. 
verse:24:8 God brings him out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of the wild ox. He shall eat up the nations his adversaries, shall break their bones in pieces, and pierce them with his arrows. 
verse:24:9 He couched, he lay down as a lion, as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? Everyone who blesses you is blessed. Everyone who curses you is cursed."
verse:24:10 Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, "I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times. 
verse:24:11 Therefore now flee you to your place! I thought to promote you to great honor; but, behold, HASHEM has kept you back from honor."
verse:24:12 Balaam said to Balak, "Didn't I also tell your messengers who you sent to me, saying, 
verse:24:13 'If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word of HASHEM, to do either good or bad of my own mind. I will say what HASHEM says'? 
verse:24:14 Now, behold, I go to my people: come, I will inform you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days."
verse:24:15 He took up his parable, and said, "Balaam the son of Beor says, the man whose eye was closed says; 
verse:24:16 he says, who hears the words of God, knows the knowledge of the Most High, and who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open: 
verse:24:17 I see him, but not now. I see him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob. A scepter will rise out of Israel, and shall strike through the corners of Moab, and break down all the sons of Sheth. 
verse:24:18 Edom shall be a possession. Seir, his enemies, also shall be a possession, while Israel does valiantly. 
verse:24:19 Out of Jacob shall one have dominion, and shall destroy the remnant from the city."
verse:24:20 He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, "Amalek was the first of the nations, But his latter end shall come to destruction."
verse:24:21 He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said, "Your dwelling place is strong. Your nest is set in the rock. 
verse:24:22 Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, until Asshur carries you away captive."
verse:24:23 He took up his parable, and said, "Alas, who shall live when God does this? 
verse:24:24 But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim. They shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber. He also shall come to destruction."
verse:24:25 Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.
verse:25:1 Israel stayed in Shittim; and the people began to play the prostitute with the daughters of Moab: 
verse:25:2 for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods; and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods. 
verse:25:3 Israel joined himself to Baal Peor: and the anger of HASHEM was kindled against Israel. 
verse:25:4 HASHEM said to Moses, "Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up to HASHEM before the sun, that the fierce anger of HASHEM may turn away from Israel."
verse:25:5 Moses said to the judges of Israel, "Everyone kill his men who have joined themselves to Baal Peor."
verse:25:6 Behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:25:7 When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand; 
verse:25:8 and he went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. 
verse:25:9 Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.
portion:Numbers 25:10 - 30:1
verse:25:10 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:25:11 "Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I didn't consume the children of Israel in my jealousy. 
verse:25:12 Therefore say, 'Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace: 
verse:25:13 and it shall be to him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.'"
verse:25:14 Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers' house among the Simeonites. 
verse:25:15 The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a fathers' house in Midian.
verse:25:16 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:25:17 "Harass the Midianites, and strike them; 
verse:25:18 for they harassed you with their wiles, with which they have deceived you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor."
verse:26:1 It happened after the plague, that HASHEM spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, 
verse:26:2 "Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers' houses, all who are able to go forth to war in Israel." 
verse:26:3 Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying, 
verse:26:4 "Take a census, from twenty years old and upward; as HASHEM commanded Moses and the children of Israel."

verse:26:9 The sons of Eliab: Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. These are that Dathan and Abiram, who were called of the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against HASHEM, 
verse:26:10 and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died; what time the fire devoured two hundred fifty men, and they became a sign.

verse:26:52 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:26:53 "To these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names. 
verse:26:54 To the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance: to everyone according to those who were numbered of him shall his inheritance be given. 
verse:26:55 Notwithstanding, the land shall be divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit. 
verse:26:56 According to the lot shall their inheritance be divided between the more and the fewer."
verse:26:57 These are those who were numbered of the Levites after their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; of Merari, the family of the Merarites. 
verse:26:58 These are the families of Levi: the family of the Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, the family of the Korahites. Kohath became the father of Amram.

verse:26:60 To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
verse:26:61 Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before HASHEM. 
verse:26:62 Those who were numbered of them were twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old and upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel. 
verse:26:63 These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. 
verse:26:64 But among these there was not a man of them who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai. 
verse:26:65 For HASHEM had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. There was not left a man of them, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
verse:27:1 Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah. 
verse:27:2 They stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, at the door of the Tent of Meeting, saying, 
verse:27:3 "Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against HASHEM in the company of Korah: but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons. 
verse:27:4 Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because he had no son? Give to us a possession among the brothers of our father."
verse:27:5 Moses brought their cause before HASHEM. 
verse:27:6 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:27:7 "The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: you shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers; and you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them. 
verse:27:8 You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'If a man dies, and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter. 
verse:27:9 If he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers. 
verse:27:10 If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father's brothers. 
verse:27:11 If his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be to the children of Israel a statute and ordinance, as HASHEM commanded Moses.'"
verse:27:12 HASHEM said to Moses, "Go up into this mountain of Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel. 
verse:27:13 When you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered; 
verse:27:14 because you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes." (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
verse:27:15 Moses spoke to HASHEM, saying, 
verse:27:16 "Let HASHEM, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation, 
verse:27:17 who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in; that the congregation of HASHEM not be as sheep which have no shepherd."
verse:27:18 HASHEM said to Moses, "Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him; 
verse:27:19 and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and commission him in their sight. 
verse:27:20 You shall put of your honor on him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may obey. 
verse:27:21 He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before HASHEM: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation."
verse:27:22 Moses did as HASHEM commanded him; and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation: 
verse:27:23 and he laid his hands on him, and commissioned him, as HASHEM spoke by Moses.
verse:28:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:28:2 "Command the children of Israel, and tell them, 'My offering, my food for my offerings made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to me, you shall observe to offer to me in their due season.' 
verse:28:3 You shall tell them, 'This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to HASHEM: male lambs a year old without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt offering. 
verse:28:4 You shall offer the one lamb in the morning, and you shall offer the other lamb at evening; 
verse:28:5 with the tenth part of an efah of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil. 
verse:28:6 It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in Mount Sinai for a pleasant aroma, an offering made by fire to HASHEM. 
verse:28:7 Its drink offering shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb. You shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to HASHEM in the holy place. 
verse:28:8 The other lamb you shall offer at evening: as the meal offering of the morning, and as the drink offering of it, you shall offer it, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to HASHEM.
verse:28:9 "'On the Sabbath day two male lambs a year old without blemish, and two tenth parts of an efah of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, and the drink offering of it: 
verse:28:10 this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, besides the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering of it.
verse:28:11 "'In the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to HASHEM: two young bulls, and one ram, seven male lambs a year old without blemish; 
verse:28:12 and three tenth parts of an efah of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, for each bull; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, for the one ram; 
verse:28:13 and a tenth part of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering to every lamb; for a burnt offering of a pleasant aroma, an offering made by fire to HASHEM. 
verse:28:14 Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year. 
verse:28:15 One male goat for a sin offering to HASHEM; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering of it.
verse:28:16 "'In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is HASHEM's Passover. 
verse:28:17 On the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten. 
verse:28:18 In the first day shall be a holy convocation: you shall do no servile work; 
verse:28:19 but you shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt offering to HASHEM: two young bulls, and one ram, and seven male lambs a year old; they shall be to you without blemish;

verse:28:24 In this way you shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to HASHEM: it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering of it. 
verse:28:25 On the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation: you shall do no servile work.
verse:28:26 "'Also in the day of the first fruits, when you offer a new meal offering to HASHEM in your feast of weeks, you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no servile work;

verse:30:1 Moses told the children of Israel according to all that HASHEM commanded Moses.
portion:Numbers 30:2 - 32:42
verse:30:2 Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, "This is the thing which HASHEM has commanded. 
verse:30:3 When a man vows a vow to HASHEM, or swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
verse:30:4 "Also when a woman vows a vow to HASHEM, and binds herself by a bond, being in her father's house, in her youth, 
verse:30:5 and her father hears her vow, and her bond with which she has bound her soul, and her father holds his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand. 
verse:30:6 But if her father disallow her in the day that he hears, none of her vows, or of her bonds with which she has bound her soul, shall stand: and HASHEM will forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
verse:30:7 "If she has a husband, while her vows are on her, or the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul, 
verse:30:8 and her husband hears it, and hold his peace at her in the day that he hears it; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she has bound her soul shall stand. 
verse:30:9 But if her husband forbids her in the day that he hears it, then he shall make void her vow which is on her, and the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul: and HASHEM will forgive her.
verse:30:10 "But the vow of a widow, or of her who is divorced, everything with which she has bound her soul, shall stand against her.
verse:30:11 "If she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath, 
verse:30:12 and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and didn't disallow her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand. 
verse:30:13 But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband has made them void; and HASHEM will forgive her. 
verse:30:14 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. 
verse:30:15 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds, which are on her: he has established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them. 
verse:30:16 But if he shall make them null and void after that he has heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity."
verse:30:17 These are the statutes, which HASHEM commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father's house.
verse:31:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:31:2 "Avenge the children of Israel for the Midianites. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people."
verse:31:3 Moses spoke to the people, saying, "Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute HASHEM's vengeance on Midian. 
verse:31:4 Of every tribe one thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, you shall send to the war." 
verse:31:5 So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. 
verse:31:6 Moses sent them, one thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the shofars for the alarm in his hand. 
verse:31:7 They warred against Midian, as HASHEM commanded Moses; and they killed every male. 
verse:31:8 They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they killed with the sword. 
verse:31:9 The children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their livestock, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey. 
verse:31:10 All their cities in the places in which they lived, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire. 
verse:31:11 They took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of animal. 
verse:31:12 They brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho. 
verse:31:13 Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them outside of the camp. 
verse:31:14 Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war. 
verse:31:15 Moses said to them, "Have you saved all the women alive? 
verse:31:16 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against HASHEM in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of HASHEM. 
verse:31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him. 
verse:31:18 But all the girls, who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
verse:31:19 "Encamp outside of the camp seven days: whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives. 
verse:31:20 As to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood, you shall purify yourselves."
verse:31:21 Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, "This is the statute of the law which HASHEM has commanded Moses: 
verse:31:22 however the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 
verse:31:23 everything that may withstand the fire, you shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity: and all that doesn't withstand the fire you shall make to go through the water. 
verse:31:24 You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean; and afterward you shall come into the camp."
verse:31:25 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:31:26 "Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of animal, you, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers' households of the congregation; 
verse:31:27 and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation. 
verse:31:28 Levy a tribute to HASHEM of the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred; of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks. 
verse:31:29 Take it of their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for HASHEM's wave offering. 
verse:31:30 Of the children of Israel's half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of all the livestock, and give them to the Levites, who perform the duty of the tabernacle of HASHEM."
verse:31:31 Moses and Eleazar the priest did as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:31:32 Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep, 
verse:31:33 and seventy-two thousand head of cattle, 
verse:31:34 and sixty-one thousand donkeys, 
verse:31:35 and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the women who had not known man by lying with him. 
verse:31:36 The half, which was the portion of those who went out to war, was in number three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep: 
verse:31:37 and HASHEM's tribute of the sheep was six hundred seventy-five. 
verse:31:38 The cattle were thirty-six thousand; of which HASHEM's tribute was seventy-two. 
verse:31:39 The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred; of which HASHEM's tribute was sixty-one. 
verse:31:40 The persons were sixteen thousand; of whom HASHEM's tribute was thirty-two persons. 
verse:31:41 Moses gave the tribute, which was HASHEM's wave offering, to Eleazar the priest, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:31:42 Of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided off from the men who warred 
verse:31:43 (now the congregation's half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep, 
verse:31:44 and thirty-six thousand head of cattle, 
verse:31:45 and thirty thousand five hundred donkeys, 
verse:31:46 and sixteen thousand persons), 
verse:31:47 even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animal, and gave them to the Levites, who performed the duty of the tabernacle of HASHEM; as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:31:48 The officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near to Moses; 
verse:31:49 and they said to Moses, "Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our command, and there lacks not one man of us. 
verse:31:50 We have brought HASHEM's offering, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for our souls before HASHEM."
verse:31:51 Moses and Eleazar the priest took their gold, even all worked jewels. 
verse:31:52 All the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to HASHEM, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels. 
verse:31:53 (The men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.) 
verse:31:54 Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the Tent of Meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel before HASHEM.
verse:32:1 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold, the place was a place for livestock; 
verse:32:2 the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying, 
verse:32:3 "Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon, 
verse:32:4 the land which HASHEM struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock; and your servants have livestock." 
verse:32:5 They said, "If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession; don't bring us over the Jordan."
verse:32:6 Moses said to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, "Shall your brothers go to the war, and shall you sit here? 
verse:32:7 Why do you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which HASHEM has given them? 
verse:32:8 Your fathers did so when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land. 
verse:32:9 For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which HASHEM had given them. 
verse:32:10 HASHEM's anger was kindled in that day, and he swore, saying, 
verse:32:11 'Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me: 
verse:32:12 except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have followed HASHEM completely.' 
verse:32:13 HASHEM's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, who had done evil in the sight of HASHEM, was consumed.
verse:32:14 "Behold, you have risen up in your fathers' place, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of HASHEM toward Israel. 
verse:32:15 For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all this people."
verse:32:16 They came near to him, and said, "We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones: 
verse:32:17 but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. 
verse:32:18 We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance. 
verse:32:19 For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward."
verse:32:20 Moses said to them, "If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves to go before HASHEM to the war, 
verse:32:21 and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before HASHEM, until he has driven out his enemies from before him, 
verse:32:22 and the land is subdued before HASHEM; then afterward you shall return, and be guiltless towards HASHEM, and towards Israel; and this land shall be to you for a possession before HASHEM.
verse:32:23 "But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against HASHEM; and be sure your sin will find you out. 
verse:32:24 Build cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth."
verse:32:25 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, "Your servants will do as my lord commands. 
verse:32:26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock, shall be there in the cities of Gilead; 
verse:32:27 but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before HASHEM to battle, as my lord says."
verse:32:28 So Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' households of the tribes of the children of Israel. 
verse:32:29 Moses said to them, "If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man who is armed to battle, before HASHEM, and the land shall be subdued before you; then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession: 
verse:32:30 but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan."
verse:32:31 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, "As HASHEM has said to your servants, so will we do. 
verse:32:32 We will pass over armed before HASHEM into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan."
verse:32:33 Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to its cities and borders, even the cities of the surrounding land. 
verse:32:34 The children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer, 
verse:32:35 and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah, 
verse:32:36 and Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep. 
verse:32:37 The children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim, 
verse:32:38 and Nebo, and Baal Meon, (their names being changed), and Sibmah: and they gave other names to the cities which they built. 
verse:32:39 The children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were therein. 
verse:32:40 Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he lived therein. 
verse:32:41 Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its towns, and called them Havvoth Jair. 
verse:32:42 Nobah went and took Kenath, and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name.

verse:33:1 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron. 
verse:33:2 Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of HASHEM: and these are their journeys according to their goings out. 
verse:33:3 They traveled from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the next day after the Passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians,

verse:33:39 Aaron was one hundred twenty-three years old when he died in Mount Hor. 
verse:33:40 The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel. 
verse:33:41 They traveled from Mount Hor, and encamped in Zalmonah.

verse:33:49 They encamped by the Jordan, from Beth Jeshimoth even to Abel Shittim in the plains of Moab. 
verse:33:50 HASHEM spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying, 
verse:33:51 Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, "When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
verse:33:52 then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, destroy all their stone idols, destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places. 
verse:33:53 You shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein; for I have given given the land to you to possess it. 
verse:33:54 You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance: wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his. You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers.
verse:33:55 "But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those you let remain of them will be as pricks in your eyes and as thorns in your sides, and they will harass you in the land in which you dwell. 
verse:33:56 It shall happen that as I thought to do to them, so will I do to you."
verse:34:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:34:2 "Command the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you come into the land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to its borders), 
verse:34:3 then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom, and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward; 
verse:34:4 and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and the goings out of it shall be southward of Kadesh Barnea; and it shall go forth to Hazar Addar, and pass along to Azmon; 
verse:34:5 and the border shall turn about from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.
verse:34:6 "'For the western border, you shall have the great sea and its border: this shall be your west border.
verse:34:7 "'This shall be your north border: from the great sea you shall mark out for you Mount Hor; 
verse:34:8 from Mount Hor you shall mark out to the entrance of Hamath; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad; 
verse:34:9 and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar Enan: this shall be your north border.
verse:34:10 "'You shall mark out your east border from Hazar Enan to Shepham; 
verse:34:11 and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward; 
verse:34:12 and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to its borders around it.'"
verse:34:13 Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, "This is the land which you shall inherit by lot, which HASHEM has commanded to give to the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe; 
verse:34:14 for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers' houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers' houses, have received, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received, their inheritance: 
verse:34:15 the two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrise."
verse:34:16 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:34:17 "These are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun. 
verse:34:18 You shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance. 
verse:34:19 These are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 
verse:34:20 Of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud. 
verse:34:21 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon. 
verse:34:22 Of the tribe of the children of Dan a prince, Bukki the son of Jogli. 
verse:34:23 Of the children of Joseph: of the tribe of the children of Manasseh a prince, Hanniel the son of Ephod. 
verse:34:24 Of the tribe of the children of Ephraim a prince, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan. 
verse:34:25 Of the tribe of the children of Zebulun a prince, Elizaphan the son of Parnach. 
verse:34:26 Of the tribe of the children of Issachar a prince, Paltiel the son of Azzan. 
verse:34:27 Of the tribe of the children of Asher a prince, Ahihud the son of Shelomi. 
verse:34:28 Of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a prince, Pedahel the son of Ammihud." 
verse:34:29 These are they whom HASHEM commanded to divide the inheritance to the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.
verse:35:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying, 
verse:35:2 "Command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and you shall give suburbs for the cities around them to the Levites. 
verse:35:3 The cities shall they have to dwell in; and their suburbs shall be for their livestock, and for their substance, and for all their animals.
verse:35:4 "The suburbs of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand cubits around it. 
verse:35:5 You shall measure outside of the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
verse:35:6 "The cities which you shall give to the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to: and besides them you shall give forty-two cities. 
verse:35:7 All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities together with their suburbs. 
verse:35:8 Concerning the cities which you shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many you shall take many; and from the few you shall take few: everyone according to his inheritance which he inherits shall give of his cities to the Levites." 
verse:35:9 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:35:10 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
verse:35:11 then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer who kills any person unwittingly may flee there. 
verse:35:12 The cities shall be to you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer not die, until he stands before the congregation for judgment. 
verse:35:13 The cities which you shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge. 
verse:35:14 You shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge. 
verse:35:15 For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the foreigner living among them, shall these six cities be for refuge; that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there.
verse:35:16 "'But if he struck him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
verse:35:17 If he struck him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
verse:35:18 Or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
verse:35:19 The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death: when he meets him, he shall put him to death. 
verse:35:20 If he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died, 
verse:35:21 or in enmity struck him with his hand, so that he died; he who struck him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meets him.
verse:35:22 "'But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled on him anything without lying in wait, 
verse:35:23 or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him, and cast it on him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm; 
verse:35:24 then the congregation shall judge between the striker and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances; 
verse:35:25 and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, where he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
verse:35:26 "'But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, where he flees, 
verse:35:27 and the avenger of blood find him outside of the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kill the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood, 
verse:35:28 because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession.
verse:35:29 "'These things shall be for a statute and ordinance to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
verse:35:30 "'Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die.
verse:35:31 "'Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death.
verse:35:32 "'You shall take no ransom for him who is fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
verse:35:33 "'So you shall not pollute the land in which you are: for blood, it pollutes the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him who shed it. 
verse:35:34 You shall not defile the land which you inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I, HASHEM, dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.'"
verse:36:1 The heads of the fathers' households of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers' households of the children of Israel: 
verse:36:2 and they said, "HASHEM commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by HASHEM to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters. 
verse:36:3 If they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance. 
verse:36:4 When the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers."
verse:36:5 Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of HASHEM, saying, "The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right. 
verse:36:6 This is the thing which HASHEM does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married. 
verse:36:7 So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall all keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. 
verse:36:8 Every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers. 
verse:36:9 So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall each keep his own inheritance."
verse:36:10 The daughters of Zelophehad did as HASHEM commanded Moses: 
verse:36:11 for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons. 
verse:36:12 They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. 
verse:36:13 These are the commandments and the ordinances which HASHEM commanded by Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.  Deuteronomy
portion:Deuteronomy 1:1 - 3:22
verse:1:1 These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suf, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab. 
verse:1:2 It is eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea. 
verse:1:3 It happened in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that HASHEM had given him in commandment to them; 
verse:1:4 after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei. 
verse:1:5 Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, 
verse:1:6 "HASHEM our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have lived long enough in this mountain: 
verse:1:7 turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all the places near there, in the Arabah, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the seashore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. 
verse:1:8 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which HASHEM swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them."
verse:1:9 I spoke to you at that time, saying, "I am not able to bear you myself alone: 
verse:1:10 HASHEM your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this day as the stars of the sky for multitude. 
verse:1:11 HASHEM, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are, and bless you, as he has promised you! 
verse:1:12 How can I myself alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? 
verse:1:13 Take wise men of understanding and well known according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you."
verse:1:14 You answered me, and said, "The thing which you have spoken is good to do." 
verse:1:15 So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes. 
verse:1:16 I commanded your judges at that time, saying, "Hear cases between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him. 
verse:1:17 You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike; you shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it." 
verse:1:18 I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do. 
verse:1:19 We traveled from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as HASHEM our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea. 
verse:1:20 I said to you, "You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which HASHEM our God gives to us. 
verse:1:21 Behold, HASHEM your God has set the land before you: go up, take possession, as HASHEM, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you; don't be afraid, neither be dismayed."
verse:1:22 You came near to me everyone of you, and said, "Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come."
verse:1:23 The thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe: 
verse:1:24 and they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out. 
verse:1:25 They took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, "It is a good land which HASHEM our God gives to us."
verse:1:26 Yet you wouldn't go up, but rebelled against the commandment of HASHEM your God: 
verse:1:27 and you murmured in your tents, and said, "Because HASHEM hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. 
verse:1:28 Where are we going up? our brothers have made our heart to melt, saying, 'The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to the sky; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.'"
verse:1:29 Then I said to you, "Don't dread, neither be afraid of them. 
verse:1:30 HASHEM your God who goes before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes, 
verse:1:31 and in the wilderness, where you have seen how that HASHEM your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place."
verse:1:32 Yet in this thing you didn't believe HASHEM your God, 
verse:1:33 who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day. 
verse:1:34 HASHEM heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying, 
verse:1:35 "Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land, which I swore to give to your fathers, 
verse:1:36 except Caleb the son of Jephunneh: he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he has trodden on, and to his children, because he has wholly followed HASHEM."
verse:1:37 Also HASHEM was angry with me for your sakes, saying, "You also shall not go in there: 
verse:1:38 Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there: encourage you him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. 
verse:1:39 Moreover your little ones, whom you said should be a prey, and your children, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it. 
verse:1:40 But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Sea of Suf."
verse:1:41 Then you answered and said to me, "We have sinned against HASHEM, we will go up and fight, according to all that HASHEM our God commanded us." Every man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill country.
verse:1:42 HASHEM said to me, "Tell them, 'Don't go up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest you be struck before your enemies.'"
verse:1:43 So I spoke to you, and you didn't listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of HASHEM, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country. 
verse:1:44 The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah. 
verse:1:45 You returned and wept before HASHEM; but HASHEM didn't listen to your voice, nor gave ear to you. 
verse:1:46 So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained.
 
verse:2:1 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Sea of Suf, as HASHEM spoke to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many days.
verse:2:2 HASHEM spoke to me, saying, 
verse:2:3 "You have encircled this mountain long enough. Turn northward. 
verse:2:4 Command the people, saying, 'You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: take good heed to yourselves therefore; 
verse:2:5 don't contend with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession. 
verse:2:6 You shall purchase food of them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.'"
verse:2:7 For HASHEM your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand; he has known your walking through this great wilderness: these forty years HASHEM your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.
verse:2:8 So we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
verse:2:9 HASHEM said to me, "Don't bother Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession."
verse:2:10 (The Emim lived therein before, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim: 
verse:2:11 these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim. 
verse:2:12 The Horites also lived in Seir before, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which HASHEM gave to them.)
verse:2:13 "Now rise up, and cross over the brook Zered." We went over the brook Zered. 
verse:2:14 The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea, until we had come over the brook Zered, were thirty-eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as HASHEM swore to them. 
verse:2:15 Moreover the hand of HASHEM was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed. 
verse:2:16 So it happened, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, 
verse:2:17 that HASHEM spoke to me, saying, 
verse:2:18 "You are this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab: 
verse:2:19 and when you come near over against the children of Ammon, don't bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession."
verse:2:20 (That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim lived therein before; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, 
verse:2:21 a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but HASHEM destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place; 
verse:2:22 as he did for the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day: 
verse:2:23 and the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and lived in their place.)
verse:2:24 "Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. 
verse:2:25 This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you."
verse:2:26 I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 
verse:2:27 "Let me pass through your land: I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left. 
verse:2:28 You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet, 
verse:2:29 as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me; until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which HASHEM our God gives us." 
verse:2:30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for HASHEM your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as at this day.
verse:2:31 HASHEM said to me, "Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you: begin to possess, that you may inherit his land." 
verse:2:32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz. 
verse:2:33 HASHEM our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him, and his sons, and all his people. 
verse:2:34 We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining: 
verse:2:35 only the livestock we took for a prey to ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken. 
verse:2:36 From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; HASHEM our God delivered up all before us: 
verse:2:37 only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn't come near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever HASHEM our God forbade us.
verse:3:1 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 
verse:3:2 HASHEM said to me, "Don't fear him; for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into your hand; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon."
verse:3:3 So HASHEM our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we struck him until none was left to him remaining. 
verse:3:4 We took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we didn't take from them; sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
verse:3:5 All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns a great many. 
verse:3:6 We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. 
verse:3:7 But all the livestock, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves. 
verse:3:8 We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon. 
verse:3:9 (The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir.) 
verse:3:10 We took all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
verse:3:11 (For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; isn't it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, after the cubit of a man.) 
verse:3:12 This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead, and its cities, gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites: 
verse:3:13 and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim. 
verse:3:14 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day.) 
verse:3:15 I gave Gilead to Machir. 
verse:3:16 To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 
verse:3:17 the Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.
verse:3:18 I commanded you at that time, saying, "HASHEM your God has given you this land to possess it: you shall pass over armed before your brothers the children of Israel, all the men of valor. 
verse:3:19 But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you, 
verse:3:20 until HASHEM gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which HASHEM your God gives them beyond the Jordan: then you shall return every man to his possession, which I have given you."
verse:3:21 I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, "Your eyes have seen all that HASHEM your God has done to these two kings: so shall HASHEM do to all the kingdoms where you go over. 
verse:3:22 You shall not fear them; for HASHEM your God, he it is who fights for you."
portion:Deuteronomy 3:23 - 7:11
verse:3:23 I begged HASHEM at that time, saying, 
verse:3:24 "My Lord HASHEM, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your strong hand: for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to your works, and according to your mighty acts? 
verse:3:25 Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon."
verse:3:26 But HASHEM was angry with me for your sakes, and didn't listen to me; and HASHEM said to me, "Let it suffice you; speak no more to me of this matter. 
verse:3:27 Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes: for you shall not go over this Jordan. 
verse:3:28 But commission Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see." 
verse:3:29 So we stayed in the valley over against Beth Peor.
verse:4:1 Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that you may live, and go in and possess the land which HASHEM, the God of your fathers, gives you. 
verse:4:2 You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish from it, that you may keep the commandments of HASHEM your God which I command you. 
verse:4:3 Your eyes have seen what HASHEM did because of Baal Peor; for all the men who followed Baal Peor, HASHEM your God has destroyed them from the midst of you. 
verse:4:4 But you who were faithful to HASHEM your God are all alive this day. 
verse:4:5 Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as HASHEM my God commanded me, that you should do so in the midst of the land where you go in to possess it. 
verse:4:6 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who shall hear all these statutes, and say, "Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people." 
verse:4:7 For what great nation is there, that has a god so near to them, as HASHEM our God is whenever we call on him? 
verse:4:8 What great nation is there, that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
verse:4:9 Only take heed to yourself, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your children and your children's children; 
verse:4:10 the day that you stood before HASHEM your God in Horeb, when HASHEM said to me, "Assemble me the people, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children." 
verse:4:11 You came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. 
verse:4:12 HASHEM spoke to you out of the midst of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; you only heard a voice. 
verse:4:13 He declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them on two tables of stone. 
verse:4:14 HASHEM commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it. 
verse:4:15 Take therefore good heed to yourselves; for you saw no kind of form on the day that HASHEM spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire. 
verse:4:16 Lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself an engraved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female, 
verse:4:17 the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky, 
verse:4:18 the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth; 
verse:4:19 and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which HASHEM your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole sky. 
verse:4:20 But HASHEM has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as at this day. 
verse:4:21 Furthermore HASHEM was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land, which HASHEM your God gives you for an inheritance: 
verse:4:22 but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but you shall go over, and possess that good land. 
verse:4:23 Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of HASHEM your God, which he made with you, and make you an engraved image in the form of anything which HASHEM your God has forbidden you. 
verse:4:24 For HASHEM your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God. 
verse:4:25 When you shall father children, and children's children, and you shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make an engraved image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of HASHEM your God, to provoke him to anger; 
verse:4:26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto you go over the Jordan to possess it; you shall not prolong your days on it, but shall utterly be destroyed. 
verse:4:27 HASHEM will scatter you among the peoples, and you shall be left few in number among the nations, where HASHEM shall lead you away. 
verse:4:28 There you shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. 
verse:4:29 But from there you shall seek HASHEM your God, and you shall find him, when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul. 
verse:4:30 When you are in oppression, and all these things have come on you, in the latter days you shall return to HASHEM your God, and listen to his voice: 
verse:4:31 for HASHEM your God is a merciful God; he will not fail you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore to them. 
verse:4:32 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and from the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has been anything as this great thing is, or has been heard like it? 
verse:4:33 Did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live? 
verse:4:34 Or has God tried to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that HASHEM your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? 
verse:4:35 It was shown to you so that you might know that HASHEM is God. There is no one else besides him. 
verse:4:36 Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you: and on earth he made you to see his great fire; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire. 
verse:4:37 Because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought you out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt; 
verse:4:38 to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as at this day. 
verse:4:39 Know therefore this day, and lay it to your heart, that HASHEM he is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is none else. 
verse:4:40 You shall keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land, which HASHEM your God gives you, forever. 
verse:4:41 Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise; 
verse:4:42 that the manslayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unawares, and didn't hate him in time past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live: 
verse:4:43 Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites. 
verse:4:44 This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel: 
verse:4:45 these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt, 
verse:4:46 beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel struck, when they came forth out of Egypt. 
verse:4:47 They took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise; 
verse:4:48 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even to Mount Sion (the same is Hermon), 
verse:4:49 and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
verse:5:1 Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, Hear, Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears this day, that you may learn them, and observe to do them. 
verse:5:2 HASHEM our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. 
verse:5:3 HASHEM didn't make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day. 
verse:5:4 HASHEM spoke with you face to face on the mountain out of the midst of the fire, 
verse:5:5 (I stood between HASHEM and you at that time, to show you the word of HASHEM: for you were afraid because of the fire, and didn't go up onto the mountain;) saying, 
verse:5:6 "I am HASHEM your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
verse:5:7 "You shall have no other gods before me.
verse:5:8 "You shall not make an engraved image for yourself, any likeness of what is in heaven above, or what is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: 
verse:5:9 you shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them; for I, HASHEM, your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me; 
verse:5:10 and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
verse:5:11 "You shall not take the name of HASHEM your God in vain: for HASHEM will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.
verse:5:12 "Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as HASHEM your God commanded you. 
verse:5:13 You shall labor six days, and do all your work; 
verse:5:14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to HASHEM your God, in which you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates; that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you. 
verse:5:15 You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and HASHEM your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm: therefore HASHEM your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
verse:5:16 "Honor your father and your mother, as HASHEM your God commanded you; that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you, in the land which HASHEM your God gives you.
verse:5:17 "You shall not murder. Neither shall you commit adultery. Neither shall you steal. Neither shall you give false testimony against your neighbor.
verse:5:18 "Neither shall you covet your neighbor's wife; neither shall you desire your neighbor's house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's."
verse:5:19 These words HASHEM spoke to all your assembly on the mountain out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. He wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me. 
verse:5:20 It happened, when you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; 
verse:5:21 and you said, "Behold, HASHEM our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God does speak with man, and he lives. 
verse:5:22 Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of HASHEM our God any more, then we shall die. 
verse:5:23 For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? 
verse:5:24 Go near, and hear all that HASHEM our God shall say: and tell us all that HASHEM our God shall tell you; and we will hear it, and do it."
verse:5:25 HASHEM heard the voice of your words, when you spoke to me; and HASHEM said to me, "I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you: they have well said all that they have spoken. 
verse:5:26 Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children forever!
verse:5:27 "Go tell them, Return to your tents. 
verse:5:28 But as for you, stand here by me, and I will tell you all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it."
verse:5:29 You shall observe to do therefore as HASHEM your God has commanded you: you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. 
verse:5:30 You shall walk in all the way which HASHEM your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.
verse:6:1 Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances, which HASHEM your God commanded to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it; 
verse:6:2 that you might fear HASHEM your God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, you, and your son, and your son's son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged. 
verse:6:3 Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as HASHEM, the God of your fathers, has promised to you, in a land flowing with milk and honey. 
verse:6:4 Hear, Israel: HASHEM is our God; HASHEM is one: 
verse:6:5 and you shall love HASHEM your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might. 
verse:6:6 These words, which I command you this day, shall be on your heart; 
verse:6:7 and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up. 
verse:6:8 You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for symbols between your eyes. 
verse:6:9 You shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates. 
verse:6:10 It shall be, when HASHEM your God shall bring you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and goodly cities, which you didn't build, 
verse:6:11 and houses full of all good things, which you didn't fill, and cisterns dug out, which you didn't dig, vineyards and olive trees, which you didn't plant, and you shall eat and be full; 
verse:6:12 then beware lest you forget HASHEM, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 
verse:6:13 You shall fear HASHEM your God; and you shall serve him, and shall swear by his name. 
verse:6:14 You shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples who are around you; 
verse:6:15 for HASHEM your God in the midst of you is a jealous God; lest the anger of HASHEM your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth. 
verse:6:16 You shall not tempt HASHEM your God, as you tempted him in Massah. 
verse:6:17 You shall diligently keep the commandments of HASHEM your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you. 
verse:6:18 You shall do that which is right and good in the sight of HASHEM; that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land which HASHEM swore to your fathers, 
verse:6:19 to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as HASHEM has spoken.
verse:6:20 When your son asks you in time to come, saying, "What do the testimonies, the statutes, and the ordinances, which HASHEM our God has commanded you mean?" 
verse:6:21 then you shall tell your son, "We were Pharaoh's bondservants in Egypt: and HASHEM brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand; 
verse:6:22 and HASHEM showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes; 
verse:6:23 and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers. 
verse:6:24 HASHEM commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear HASHEM our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as at this day. 
verse:6:25 It shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all this commandment before HASHEM our God, as he has commanded us."
verse:7:1 When HASHEM your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before you, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than you; 
verse:7:2 and when HASHEM your God shall deliver them up before you, and you shall strike them; then you shall utterly destroy them: you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them; 
verse:7:3 neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you shall not give to his son, nor shall you take his daughter for your son. 
verse:7:4 For he will turn away your son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so the anger of HASHEM would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly. 
verse:7:5 But you shall deal with them like this: you shall break down their altars, and dash their pillars in pieces, and cut down their Asherim, and burn their engraved images with fire. 
verse:7:6 For you are a holy people to HASHEM your God: HASHEM your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth. 
verse:7:7 HASHEM didn't set his love on you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all peoples: 
verse:7:8 but because HASHEM loves you, and because he would keep the oath which he swore to your fathers, has HASHEM brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 
verse:7:9 Know therefore that HASHEM your God, he is God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with them who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations, 
verse:7:10 and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him who hates him, he will repay him to his face. 
verse:7:11 You shall therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command you this day, to do them.
portion:Deuteronomy 7:12 - 11:25
verse:7:12 It shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances, and keep and do them, that HASHEM your God will keep with you the covenant and the loving kindness which he swore to your fathers: 
verse:7:13 and he will love you, and bless you, and multiply you; he will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock, in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you. 
verse:7:14 You shall be blessed above all peoples: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your livestock. 
verse:7:15 HASHEM will take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, he will put on you, but will lay them on all those who hate you. 
verse:7:16 You shall consume all the peoples whom HASHEM your God shall deliver to you; your eye shall not pity them: neither shall you serve their gods; for that will be a snare to you. 
verse:7:17 If you shall say in your heart, "These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?" 
verse:7:18 you shall not be afraid of them: you shall well remember what HASHEM your God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt; 
verse:7:19 the great trials which your eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which HASHEM your God brought you out: so shall HASHEM your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid. 
verse:7:20 Moreover HASHEM your God will send the hornet among them, until those who are left, and hide themselves, perish from before you. 
verse:7:21 You shall not be scared of them; for HASHEM your God is in the midst of you, a great and awesome God. 
verse:7:22 HASHEM your God will cast out those nations before you by little and little: you may not consume them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you. 
verse:7:23 But HASHEM your God will deliver them up before you, and will confuse them with a great confusion, until they be destroyed. 
verse:7:24 He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name to perish from under the sky: no man shall be able to stand before you, until you have destroyed them. 
verse:7:25 You shall burn the engraved images of their gods with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared in it; for it is an abomination to HASHEM your God. 
verse:7:26 You shall not bring an abomination into your house, and become a devoted thing like it. You shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.
verse:8:1 You shall observe to do all the commandment which I command you this day, that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which HASHEM swore to your fathers. 
verse:8:2 You shall remember all the way which HASHEM your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or not. 
verse:8:3 He humbled you, and allowed you to be hungry, and fed you with manna, which you didn't know, neither did your fathers know; that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only, but man lives by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of HASHEM. 
verse:8:4 Your clothing didn't grow old on you, neither did your foot swell, these forty years. 
verse:8:5 You shall consider in your heart that as a man chastens his son, so HASHEM your God chastens you. 
verse:8:6 You shall keep the commandments of HASHEM your God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him. 
verse:8:7 For HASHEM your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of springs, and underground water flowing into valleys and hills; 
verse:8:8 a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates; a land of olive trees and honey; 
verse:8:9 a land in which you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig copper. 
verse:8:10 You shall eat and be full, and you shall bless HASHEM your God for the good land which he has given you. 
verse:8:11 Beware lest you forget HASHEM your God, in not keeping his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command you this day: 
verse:8:12 lest, when you have eaten and are full, and have built goodly houses, and lived therein; 
verse:8:13 and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied; 
verse:8:14 then your heart be lifted up, and you forget HASHEM your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; 
verse:8:15 who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where there was no water; who brought you forth water out of the rock of flint; 
verse:8:16 who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers didn't know; that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end: 
verse:8:17 and lest you say in your heart, "My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth." 
verse:8:18 But you shall remember HASHEM your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as at this day.
verse:8:19 It shall be, if you shall forget HASHEM your God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish. 
verse:8:20 As the nations that HASHEM makes to perish before you, so you shall perish; because you wouldn't listen to the voice of HASHEM your God.
verse:9:1 Hear, Israel: you are to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the sky, 
verse:9:2 a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say, "Who can stand before the sons of Anak?" 
verse:9:3 Know therefore this day, that HASHEM your God is he who goes over before you as a devouring fire; he will destroy them, and he will bring them down before you: so you shall drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as HASHEM has spoken to you.
verse:9:4 Don't say in your heart, after HASHEM your God has thrust them out from before you, saying, "For my righteousness HASHEM has brought me in to possess this land;" because HASHEM drives them out before you because of the wickedness of these nations. 
verse:9:5 Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart, do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations HASHEM your God does drive them out from before you, and that he may establish the word which HASHEM swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
verse:9:6 Know therefore, that HASHEM your God doesn't give you this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people. 
verse:9:7 Remember, don't forget, how you provoked HASHEM your God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt, until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against HASHEM. 
verse:9:8 Also in Horeb you provoked HASHEM to wrath, and HASHEM was angry with you to destroy you. 
verse:9:9 When I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which HASHEM made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water. 
verse:9:10 HASHEM delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them were all the words which HASHEM spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
verse:9:11 It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that HASHEM gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant. 
verse:9:12 HASHEM said to me, "Arise, get down quickly from here; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image."
verse:9:13 Furthermore HASHEM spoke to me, saying, "I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people: 
verse:9:14 let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they."
verse:9:15 So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands. 
verse:9:16 I looked, and behold, you had sinned against HASHEM your God; you had made yourselves a molten calf: you had turned aside quickly out of the way which HASHEM had commanded you. 
verse:9:17 I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes. 
verse:9:18 I fell down before HASHEM, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water; because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of HASHEM, to provoke him to anger. 
verse:9:19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, with which HASHEM was angry against you to destroy you. But HASHEM listened to me that time also. 
verse:9:20 HASHEM was very angry with Aaron to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. 
verse:9:21 I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast its dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain. 
verse:9:22 At Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah, you provoked HASHEM to wrath. 
verse:9:23 When HASHEM sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, "Go up and possess the land which I have given you;" then you rebelled against the commandment of HASHEM your God, and you didn't believe him, nor listen to his voice. 
verse:9:24 You have been rebellious against HASHEM from the day that I knew you. 
verse:9:25 So I fell down before HASHEM the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because HASHEM had said he would destroy you. 
verse:9:26 I prayed to HASHEM, and said, "HASHEM GOD, don't destroy your people and your inheritance, that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 
verse:9:27 Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; don't look to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin, 
verse:9:28 lest the land you brought us out from say, 'Because HASHEM was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.' 
verse:9:29 Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm."
verse:10:1 At that time HASHEM said to me, "Cut two tables of stone like the first, and come up to me onto the mountain, and make an ark of wood. 
verse:10:2 I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark." 
verse:10:3 So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two tables of stone like the first, and went up onto the mountain, having the two tables in my hand. 
verse:10:4 He wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which HASHEM spoke to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and HASHEM gave them to me. 
verse:10:5 I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are as HASHEM commanded me. 
verse:10:6 (The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his place. 
verse:10:7 From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water. 
verse:10:8 At that time HASHEM set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of HASHEM, to stand before HASHEM to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day. 
verse:10:9 Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers; HASHEM is his inheritance, according as HASHEM your God spoke to him.) 
verse:10:10 I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and HASHEM listened to me that time also; HASHEM would not destroy you. 
verse:10:11 HASHEM said to me, "Arise, take your journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them."
verse:10:12 Now, Israel, what does HASHEM your God require of you, but to fear HASHEM your God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve HASHEM your God with all your heart and with all your soul, 
verse:10:13 to keep the commandments of HASHEM, and his statutes, which I command you this day for your good? 
verse:10:14 Behold, to HASHEM your God belongs heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein. 
verse:10:15 Only HASHEM had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples, as at this day. 
verse:10:16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked. 
verse:10:17 For HASHEM your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awesome, who doesn't respect persons, nor takes reward. 
verse:10:18 He does execute justice for the fatherless and widow, and loves the foreigner, in giving him food and clothing. 
verse:10:19 Therefore love the foreigner; for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. 
verse:10:20 You shall fear HASHEM your God; you shall serve him; and you shall cling to him, and you shall swear by his name. 
verse:10:21 He is your praise, and he is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things, which your eyes have seen. 
verse:10:22 Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now HASHEM your God has made you as the stars of the sky for multitude.
verse:11:1 Therefore you shall love HASHEM your God, and keep his instructions, and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments, always. 
verse:11:2 Know this day: for I don't speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of HASHEM your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his outstretched arm, 
verse:11:3 and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land; 
verse:11:4 and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Sea of Suf to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how HASHEM has destroyed them to this day; 
verse:11:5 and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place; 
verse:11:6 and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel: 
verse:11:7 but your eyes have seen all the great work of HASHEM which he did. 
verse:11:8 Therefore you shall keep all the commandment which I command you this day, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land, where you go over to possess it; 
verse:11:9 and that you may prolong your days in the land, which HASHEM swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
verse:11:10 For the land, where you go in to possess it, isn't as the land of Egypt, that you came out from, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs; 
verse:11:11 but the land, where you go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water of the rain of the sky, 
verse:11:12 a land which HASHEM your God cares for: the eyes of HASHEM your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year. 
verse:11:13 It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love HASHEM your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, 
verse:11:14 that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, and your new wine, and your oil. 
verse:11:15 I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full. 
verse:11:16 Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 
verse:11:17 and the anger of HASHEM be kindled against you, and he shut up the sky, so that there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield its fruit; and you perish quickly from off the good land which HASHEM gives you. 
verse:11:18 Therefore you shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and you shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for symbols between your eyes. 
verse:11:19 You shall teach them your children, talking of them, when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up. 
verse:11:20 You shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates; 
verse:11:21 that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which HASHEM swore to your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth. 
verse:11:22 For if you shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to love HASHEM your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cling to him; 
verse:11:23 then will HASHEM drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves. 
verse:11:24 Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the hinder sea shall be your border. 
verse:11:25 No man shall be able to stand before you: HASHEM your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread on, as he has spoken to you.
portion:Deuteronomy 11:26 - 16:17
verse:11:26 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse: 
verse:11:27 the blessing, if you shall listen to the commandments of HASHEM your God, which I command you this day; 
verse:11:28 and the curse, if you shall not listen to the commandments of HASHEM your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which you have not known. 
verse:11:29 It shall happen, when HASHEM your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal. 
verse:11:30 Aren't they beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh? 
verse:11:31 For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which HASHEM your God gives you, and you shall possess it, and dwell therein. 
verse:11:32 You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day.
verse:12:1 These are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which HASHEM, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess it, all the days that you live on the earth. 
verse:12:2 You shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree: 
verse:12:3 and you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods; and you shall destroy their name out of that place. 
verse:12:4 You shall not do so to HASHEM your God. 
verse:12:5 But to the place which HASHEM your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, even to his habitation you shall seek, and there you shall come; 
verse:12:6 and there you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the wave offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock: 
verse:12:7 and there you shall eat before HASHEM your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, in which HASHEM your God has blessed you. 
verse:12:8 You shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatever is right in his own eyes; 
verse:12:9 for you haven't yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which HASHEM your God gives you. 
verse:12:10 But when you go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which HASHEM your God causes you to inherit, and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you, so that you dwell in safety; 
verse:12:11 then it shall happen that to the place which HASHEM your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, there you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the wave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to HASHEM. 
verse:12:12 You shall rejoice before HASHEM your God, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your male servants, and your female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you. 
verse:12:13 Take heed to yourself that you don't offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see; 
verse:12:14 but in the place which HASHEM shall choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you. 
verse:12:15 Notwithstanding, you may kill and eat flesh within all your gates, after all the desire of your soul, according to the blessing of HASHEM your God which he has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart. 
verse:12:16 Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it out on the earth as water. 
verse:12:17 You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your freewill offerings, nor the wave offering of your hand; 
verse:12:18 but you shall eat them before HASHEM your God in the place which HASHEM your God shall choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your male servant, and your female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates: and you shall rejoice before HASHEM your God in all that you put your hand to. 
verse:12:19 Take heed to yourself that you don't forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.
verse:12:20 When HASHEM your God shall enlarge your border, as he has promised you, and you shall say, "I want to eat meat," because your soul desires to eat meat; you may eat meat, after all the desire of your soul. 
verse:12:21 If the place which HASHEM your God shall choose, to put his name there, is too far from you, then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock, which HASHEM has given you, as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates, after all the desire of your soul. 
verse:12:22 Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so you shall eat of it: the unclean and the clean may eat of it alike. 
verse:12:23 Only be sure that you don't eat the blood: for the blood is the life; and you shall not eat the life with the flesh. 
verse:12:24 You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the earth as water. 
verse:12:25 You shall not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of HASHEM. 
verse:12:26 Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take, and go to the place which HASHEM shall choose: 
verse:12:27 and you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of HASHEM your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of HASHEM your God; and you shall eat the flesh. 
verse:12:28 Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you forever, when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of HASHEM your God.
verse:12:29 When HASHEM your God shall cut off the nations from before you, where you go in to dispossess them, and you dispossess them, and dwell in their land; 
verse:12:30 take heed to yourself that you not be ensnared to follow them, after that they are destroyed from before you; and that you not inquire after their gods, saying, "How do these nations serve their gods? I will do likewise." 
verse:12:31 You shall not do so to HASHEM your God: for every abomination to HASHEM, which he hates, have they done to their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods. 
verse:13:1 Whatever thing I command you, that you shall observe to do: you shall not add thereto, nor diminish from it.
verse:13:2 If there arise in the midst of you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he give you a sign or a wonder, 
verse:13:3 and the sign or the wonder come to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, "Let us go after other gods" (which you have not known) "and let us serve them;" 
verse:13:4 you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or to that dreamer of dreams: for HASHEM your God proves you, to know whether you love HASHEM your God with all your heart and with all your soul. 
verse:13:5 You shall walk after HASHEM your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and you shall serve him, and cling to him. 
verse:13:6 That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he has spoken rebellion against HASHEM your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out of the way which HASHEM your God commanded you to walk in. So you shall put away the evil from the midst of you.
verse:13:7 If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend, who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, "Let us go and serve other gods," which you have not known, you, nor your fathers; 
verse:13:8 of the gods of the peoples who are around you, near to you, or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth; 
verse:13:9 you shall not consent to him, nor listen to him; neither shall your eye pity him, neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him: 
verse:13:10 but you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. 
verse:13:11 You shall stone him to death with stones, because he has sought to draw you away from HASHEM your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 
verse:13:12 All Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall not do any more such wickedness as this is in the midst of you.
verse:13:13 If you shall hear tell concerning one of your cities, which HASHEM your God gives you to dwell there, saying, 
verse:13:14 Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of you, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, "Let us go and serve other gods," which you have not known; 
verse:13:15 then you shall inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is done in the midst of you, 
verse:13:16 you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein and its livestock, with the edge of the sword. 
verse:13:17 You shall gather all its spoil into the midst of its street, and shall burn with fire the city, and all its spoil every whit, to HASHEM your God: and it shall be a heap forever; it shall not be built again. 
verse:13:18 Nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand; that HASHEM may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show you mercy, and have compassion on you, and multiply you, as he has sworn to your fathers; 
verse:13:19 when you shall listen to the voice of HASHEM your God, to keep all his commandments which I command you this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of HASHEM your God.
verse:14:1 You are the children of HASHEM your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead. 
verse:14:2 For you are a holy people to HASHEM your God, and HASHEM has chosen you to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth. 
verse:14:3 You shall not eat any abominable thing. 
verse:14:4 These are the animals which you may eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat, 
verse:14:5 the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat, and the ibex, and the antelope, and the chamois. 
verse:14:6 Every animal that parts the hoof, and has the hoof cloven in two and chews the cud, among the animals, that may you eat. 
verse:14:7 Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of those who have the hoof cloven: the camel, and the hare, and the rabbit; because they chew the cud but don't part the hoof, they are unclean to you. 
verse:14:8 The pig, because it has a split hoof but doesn't chew the cud, is unclean to you: of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch. 
verse:14:9 These you may eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales may you eat; 
verse:14:10 and whatever doesn't have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean to you. 
verse:14:11 Of all clean birds you may eat. 
verse:14:12 But these are they of which you shall not eat: the eagle, and the vulture, and the osprey, 
verse:14:13 and the red kite, and the falcon, and the kite after its kind, 
verse:14:14 and every raven after its kind, 
verse:14:15 and the ostrich, and the owl, and the seagull, and the hawk after its kind, 
verse:14:16 the little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl, 
verse:14:17 and the pelican, and the vulture, and the cormorant, 
verse:14:18 and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat. 
verse:14:19 All winged creeping things are unclean to you: they shall not be eaten. 
verse:14:20 Of all clean birds you may eat. 
verse:14:21 You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself: you may give it to the foreigner living among you who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner: for you are a holy people to HASHEM your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk. 
verse:14:22 You shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed, that which comes forth from the field year by year. 
verse:14:23 You shall eat before HASHEM your God, in the place which he shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, the tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock; that you may learn to fear HASHEM your God always. 
verse:14:24 If the way is too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it, because the place is too far from you, which HASHEM your God shall choose, to set his name there, when HASHEM your God shall bless you; 
verse:14:25 then you shall turn it into money, and bind up the money in your hand, and shall go to the place which HASHEM your God shall choose: 
verse:14:26 and you shall bestow the money for whatever your soul desires, for cattle, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatever your soul asks of you; and you shall eat there before HASHEM your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your household. 
verse:14:27 The Levite who is within your gates, you shall not forsake him; for he has no portion nor inheritance with you. 
verse:14:28 At the end of every three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase in the same year, and shall lay it up within your gates: 
verse:14:29 and the Levite, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you, and the foreigner living among you, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that HASHEM your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.
verse:15:1 At the end of every seven years you shall make a release. 
verse:15:2 This is the way of the release: every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother; because HASHEM's release has been proclaimed. 
verse:15:3 Of a foreigner you may exact it: but whatever of your is with your brother your hand shall release. 
verse:15:4 However there shall be no poor with you; (for HASHEM will surely bless you in the land which HASHEM your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it;) 
verse:15:5 if only you diligently listen to the voice of HASHEM your God, to observe to do all this commandment which I command you this day. 
verse:15:6 For HASHEM your God will bless you, as he promised you: and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow; and you shall rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over you. 
verse:15:7 If a poor man, one of your brothers, is with you within any of your gates in your land which HASHEM your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother; 
verse:15:8 but you shall surely open your hand to him, and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need, which he lacks. 
verse:15:9 Beware that there not be a base thought in your heart, saying, "The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand;" and your eye be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing; and he cry to HASHEM against you, and it be sin to you. 
verse:15:10 You shall surely give him, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him; because that for this thing HASHEM your God will bless you in all your work, and in all that you put your hand to. 
verse:15:11 For the poor will never cease out of the land: therefore I command you, saying, You shall surely open your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor, in your land. 
verse:15:12 If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you, and serves you six years; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you. 
verse:15:13 When you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty: 
verse:15:14 you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, and out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress; as HASHEM your God has blessed you, you shall give to him. 
verse:15:15 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land of Egypt, and HASHEM your God redeemed you: therefore I command you this thing today. 
verse:15:16 It shall be, if he tells you, "I will not go out from you;" because he loves you and your house, because he is well with you; 
verse:15:17 then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant forever. Also to your female servant you shall do likewise. 
verse:15:18 It shall not seem hard to you, when you let him go free from you; for to the double of the hire of a hireling has he served you six years: and HASHEM your God will bless you in all that you do. 
verse:15:19 All the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock you shall sanctify to HASHEM your God: you shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock. 
verse:15:20 You shall eat it before HASHEM your God year by year in the place which HASHEM shall choose, you and your household. 
verse:15:21 If it has any blemish, is lame or blind, or has any defect whatever, you shall not sacrifice it to HASHEM your God. 
verse:15:22 You shall eat it within your gates: the unclean and the clean shall eat it alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart. 
verse:15:23 Only you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it out on the ground as water.
verse:16:1 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the Passover to HASHEM your God; for in the month of Abib HASHEM your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night. 
verse:16:2 You shall sacrifice the Passover to HASHEM your God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which HASHEM shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there. 
verse:16:3 You shall eat no leavened bread with it. You shall eat unleavened bread with it seven days, even the bread of affliction; for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life. 
verse:16:4 No yeast shall be seen with you in all your borders seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which you sacrifice the first day at evening, remain all night until the morning. 
verse:16:5 You may not sacrifice the Passover within any of your gates, which HASHEM your God gives you; 
verse:16:6 but at the place which HASHEM your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell in, there you shall sacrifice the Passover at evening, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you came forth out of Egypt. 
verse:16:7 You shall roast and eat it in the place which HASHEM your God shall choose: and you shall turn in the morning, and go to your tents. 
verse:16:8 Six days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to HASHEM your God; you shall do no work. 
verse:16:9 You shall count for yourselves seven weeks: from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain you shall begin to number seven weeks. 
verse:16:10 You shall keep the feast of weeks to HASHEM your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your hand, which you shall give, according as HASHEM your God blesses you: 
verse:16:11 and you shall rejoice before HASHEM your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your male servant, and your female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates, and the foreigner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are in the midst of you, in the place which HASHEM your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there. 
verse:16:12 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt: and you shall observe and do these statutes. 
verse:16:13 You shall keep the feast of booths seven days, after that you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress: 
verse:16:14 and you shall rejoice in your feast, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your male servant, and your female servant, and the Levite, and the foreigner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your gates. 
verse:16:15 You shall keep a feast to HASHEM your God seven days in the place which HASHEM shall choose; because HASHEM your God will bless you in all your increase, and in all the work of your hands, and you shall be altogether joyful. 
verse:16:16 Three times in a year shall all your males appear before HASHEM your God in the place which he shall choose: in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of booths; and they shall not appear before HASHEM empty: 
verse:16:17 every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of HASHEM your God which he has given you.
portion:Deuteronomy 16:18 - 21:9
verse:16:18 You shall make judges and officers in all your gates, which HASHEM your God gives you, according to your tribes; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment. 
verse:16:19 You shall not wrest justice: you shall not respect persons; neither shall you take a bribe; for a bribe does blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous. 
verse:16:20 You shall follow that which is altogether just, that you may live, and inherit the land which HASHEM your God gives you. 
verse:16:21 You shall not plant for yourselves an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of HASHEM your God, which you shall make for yourselves. 
verse:16:22 Neither shall you set yourself up a pillar; which HASHEM your God hates.
verse:17:1 You shall not sacrifice to HASHEM your God an ox, or a sheep, in which is a blemish, or anything evil; for that is an abomination to HASHEM your God. 
verse:17:2 If there is found in the midst of you, within any of your gates which HASHEM your God gives you, man or woman, who does that which is evil in the sight of HASHEM your God, in transgressing his covenant, 
verse:17:3 and has gone and served other gods, and worshiped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the army of the sky, which I have not commanded; 
verse:17:4 and it be told you, and you have heard of it, then you shall inquire diligently; and behold, if it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is done in Israel, 
verse:17:5 then you shall bring forth that man or that woman, who has done this evil thing, to your gates, even the man or the woman; and you shall stone them to death with stones. 
verse:17:6 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he who is to die be put to death; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death. 
verse:17:7 The hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So you shall put away the evil from the midst of you. 
verse:17:8 If there arises a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates; then you shall arise, and go up to the place which HASHEM your God shall choose; 
verse:17:9 and you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those days: and you shall inquire; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment. 
verse:17:10 You shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show you from that place which HASHEM shall choose; and you shall observe to do according to all that they shall teach you: 
verse:17:11 according to the tenor of the law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do; you shall not turn aside from the sentence which they shall show you, to the right hand, nor to the left. 
verse:17:12 The man who does presumptuously, in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before HASHEM your God, or to the judge, even that man shall die: and you shall put away the evil from Israel. 
verse:17:13 All the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.
verse:17:14 When you have come to the land which HASHEM your God gives you, and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say, "I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are around me;" 
verse:17:15 you shall surely set him king over yourselves, whom HASHEM your God shall choose: one from among your brothers you shall set king over you; you may not put a foreigner over you, who is not your brother. 
verse:17:16 Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses; because HASHEM has said to you, "You shall not go back that way again." 
verse:17:17 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart not turn away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.
verse:17:18 It shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book, out of that which is before the priests the Levites: 
verse:17:19 and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear HASHEM his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them; 
verse:17:20 that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he not turn aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the midst of Israel.
verse:18:1 The priests the Levites, all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of HASHEM made by fire, and his inheritance. 
verse:18:2 They shall have no inheritance among their brothers: HASHEM is their inheritance, as he has spoken to them. 
verse:18:3 This shall be the priests' due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw. 
verse:18:4 The first fruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, you shall give him. 
verse:18:5 For HASHEM your God has chosen him out of all your tribes, to stand to minister in the name of HASHEM, him and his sons for ever. 
verse:18:6 If a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel, where he lives as a foreigner, and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which HASHEM shall choose; 
verse:18:7 then he shall minister in the name of HASHEM his God, as all his brothers the Levites do, who stand there before HASHEM. 
verse:18:8 They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which comes of the sale of his patrimony. 
verse:18:9 When you have come into the land which HASHEM your God gives you, you shall not learn to do after the abominations of those nations. 
verse:18:10 There shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who practices sorcery, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer, 
verse:18:11 or a charmer, or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer. 
verse:18:12 For whoever does these things is an abomination to HASHEM: and because of these abominations HASHEM your God does drive them out from before you. 
verse:18:13 You shall be perfect with HASHEM your God. 
verse:18:14 For these nations, that you shall dispossess, listen to those who practice sorcery, and to diviners; but as for you, HASHEM your God has not allowed you so to do. 
verse:18:15 HASHEM your God will raise up to you a prophet from the midst of you, of your brothers, like me. You shall listen to him. 
verse:18:16 This is according to all that you desired of HASHEM your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, "Let me not hear again the voice of HASHEM my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I not die."
verse:18:17 HASHEM said to me, "They have well said that which they have spoken. 
verse:18:18 I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers, like you; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him. 
verse:18:19 It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him. 
verse:18:20 But the prophet, who shall speak a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die."
verse:18:21 If you say in your heart, "How shall we know the word which HASHEM has not spoken?" 
verse:18:22 when a prophet speaks in the name of HASHEM, if the thing doesn't follow, nor happen, that is the thing which HASHEM has not spoken: the prophet has spoken it presumptuously, you shall not be afraid of him.
verse:19:1 When HASHEM your God shall cut off the nations, whose land HASHEM your God gives you, and you succeed them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses; 
verse:19:2 you shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land, which HASHEM your God gives you to possess it. 
verse:19:3 You shall prepare you the way, and divide the borders of your land, which HASHEM your God causes you to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may flee there. 
verse:19:4 This is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee there and live: whoever kills his neighbor unawares, and didn't hate him in time past; 
verse:19:5 as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle, and lights on his neighbor, so that he dies; he shall flee to one of these cities and live: 
verse:19:6 lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he didn't hate him in time past. 
verse:19:7 Therefore I command you, saying, You shall set apart three cities for yourselves. 
verse:19:8 If HASHEM your God enlarges your border, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land which he promised to give to your fathers; 
verse:19:9 if you keep all this commandment to do it, which I command you this day, to love HASHEM your God, and to walk ever in his ways; then you shall add three cities more for yourselves, besides these three: 
verse:19:10 that innocent blood not be shed in the midst of your land, which HASHEM your God gives you for an inheritance, and so blood be on you. 
verse:19:11 But if any man hates his neighbor, and lies in wait for him, and rises up against him, and strikes him mortally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities; 
verse:19:12 then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. 
verse:19:13 Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall put away the innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with you. 
verse:19:14 You shall not remove your neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit, in the land that HASHEM your God gives you to possess it. 
verse:19:15 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established. 
verse:19:16 If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing, 
verse:19:17 then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before HASHEM, before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days; 
verse:19:18 and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother; 
verse:19:19 then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother: so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you. 
verse:19:20 Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of you. 
verse:19:21 Your eyes shall not pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
verse:20:1 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and see horses, chariots, and a people more than you, you shall not be afraid of them; for HASHEM your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. 
verse:20:2 It shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people, 
verse:20:3 and shall tell them, "Hear, Israel, you draw near this day to battle against your enemies: don't let your heart faint; don't be afraid, nor tremble, neither be scared of them; 
verse:20:4 for HASHEM your God is he who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you."
verse:20:5 The officers shall speak to the people, saying, "What man is there who has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. 
verse:20:6 What man is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use its fruit. 
verse:20:7 What man is there who has pledged to be married a wife, and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her." 
verse:20:8 The officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, "What man is there who is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go and return to his house, lest his brother's heart melt as his heart." 
verse:20:9 It shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people, that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people.
verse:20:10 When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it. 
verse:20:11 It shall be, if it makes you answer of peace, and opens to you, then it shall be, that all the people who are found therein shall become tributary to you, and shall serve you. 
verse:20:12 If it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it: 
verse:20:13 and when HASHEM your God delivers it into your hand, you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the sword: 
verse:20:14 but the women, and the little ones, and the livestock, and all that is in the city, even all its spoil, you shall take for a prey to yourself; and you shall eat the spoil of your enemies, which HASHEM your God has given you. 
verse:20:15 Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations. 
verse:20:16 But of the cities of these peoples, that HASHEM your God gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes; 
verse:20:17 but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as HASHEM your God has commanded you; 
verse:20:18 that they not teach you to do after all their abominations, which they have done to their gods; so would you sin against HASHEM your God. 
verse:20:19 When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an axe against them; for you may eat of them, and you shall not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged of you? 
verse:20:20 Only the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food, you shall destroy and cut them down; and you shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it fall.
verse:21:1 If one be found slain in the land which HASHEM your God gives you to possess it, lying in the field, and it isn't known who has struck him; 
verse:21:2 then your elders and your judges shall come forth, and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is slain: 
verse:21:3 and it shall be, that the city which is nearest to the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hasn't been worked with, and which has not drawn in the yoke; 
verse:21:4 and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley. 
verse:21:5 The priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them HASHEM your God has chosen to minister to him, and to bless in the name of HASHEM; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be. 
verse:21:6 All the elders of that city, who are nearest to the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley; 
verse:21:7 and they shall answer and say, "Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it. 
verse:21:8 Forgive, HASHEM, your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and don't allow innocent blood in the midst of your people Israel." The blood shall be forgiven them. 
verse:21:9 So you shall put away the innocent blood from the midst of you, when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of HASHEM.
portion:Deuteronomy 21:10 - 25:19
verse:21:10 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and HASHEM your God delivers them into your hands, and you carry them away captive, 
verse:21:11 and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you have a desire to her, and would take her to you as wife; 
verse:21:12 then you shall bring her home to your house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; 
verse:21:13 and she shall put the clothing of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in your house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that you shall go in to her, and be her husband, and she shall be your wife. 
verse:21:14 It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go where she will; but you shall not sell her at all for money, you shall not deal with her as a slave, because you have humbled her. 
verse:21:15 If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers who was hated; 
verse:21:16 then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn: 
verse:21:17 but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his. 
verse:21:18 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not listen to them; 
verse:21:19 then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate of his place; 
verse:21:20 and they shall tell the elders of his city, "This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard." 
verse:21:21 All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones: so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
verse:21:22 If a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and you hang him on a tree; 
verse:21:23 his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall surely bury him the same day; for he who is hanged is accursed of God; that you don't defile your land which HASHEM your God gives you for an inheritance.
verse:22:1 You shall not see your brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide yourself from them: you shall surely bring them again to your brother. 
verse:22:2 If your brother isn't near to you, or if you don't know him, then you shall bring it home to your house, and it shall be with you until your brother seek after it, and you shall restore it to him. 
verse:22:3 So you shall do with his donkey; and so you shall do with his garment; and so you shall do with every lost thing of your brother's, which he has lost, and you have found: you may not hide yourself. 
verse:22:4 You shall not see your brother's donkey or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them: you shall surely help him to lift them up again. 
verse:22:5 A woman shall not wear men's clothing, neither shall a man put on women's clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to HASHEM your God. 
verse:22:6 If a bird's nest chance to be before you in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall not take the hen with the young: 
verse:22:7 you shall surely let the hen go, but the young you may take to yourself; that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days. 
verse:22:8 When you build a new house, then you shall make a battlement for your roof, that you don't bring blood on your house, if any man fall from there. 
verse:22:9 You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the whole fruit be forfeited, the seed which you have sown, and the increase of the vineyard. 
verse:22:10 You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together. 
verse:22:11 You shall not wear a mixed stuff, wool and linen together. 
verse:22:12 You shall make yourselves tzitzit on the four borders of your cloak, with which you cover yourself.
verse:22:13 If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, and hates her, 
verse:22:14 and accuses her of shameful things, and brings up an evil name on her, and says, "I took this woman, and when I came near to her, I didn't find in her the tokens of virginity;" 
verse:22:15 then shall the father of the young lady, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the young lady's virginity to the elders of the city in the gate; 
verse:22:16 and the young lady's father shall tell the elders, "I gave my daughter to this man to wife, and he hates her; 
verse:22:17 and behold, he has accused her of shameful things, saying, 'I didn't find in your daughter the tokens of virginity;' and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity." They shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city. 
verse:22:18 The elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him; 
verse:22:19 and they shall fine him one hundred shekels of silver, and give them to the father of the young lady, because he has brought up an evil name on a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.
verse:22:20 But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the young lady; 
verse:22:21 then they shall bring out the young lady to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done folly in Israel, to play the prostitute in her father's house: so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you. 
verse:22:22 If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, the man who lay with the woman, and the woman: so you shall put away the evil from Israel. 
verse:22:23 If there is a young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married to a husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; 
verse:22:24 then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones; the lady, because she didn't cry, being in the city; and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor's wife: so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you. 
verse:22:25 But if the man find the lady who is pledged to be married in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her; then the man only who lay with her shall die: 
verse:22:26 but to the lady you shall do nothing; there is in the lady no sin worthy of death: for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and kills him, even so is this matter; 
verse:22:27 for he found her in the field, the pledged to be married lady cried, and there was none to save her. 
verse:22:28 If a man find a lady who is a virgin, who is not pledged to be married, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; 
verse:22:29 then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he has humbled her; he may not put her away all his days.
verse:23:1 A man shall not take his father's wife, and shall not uncover his father's skirt. 
verse:23:2 He who is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the assembly of HASHEM. 
verse:23:3 A bastard shall not enter into the assembly of HASHEM; even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of HASHEM. 
verse:23:4 An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of HASHEM; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging to them enter into the assembly of HASHEM forever: 
verse:23:5 because they didn't meet you with bread and with water in the way, when you came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you. 
verse:23:6 Nevertheless HASHEM your God wouldn't listen to Balaam; but HASHEM your God turned the curse into a blessing to you, because HASHEM your God loved you. 
verse:23:7 You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days forever. 
verse:23:8 You shall not abhor an Edomite; for he is your brother: you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you lived as a foreigner in his land. 
verse:23:9 The children of the third generation who are born to them shall enter into the assembly of HASHEM. 
verse:23:10 When you go forth in camp against your enemies, then you shall keep yourselves from every evil thing. 
verse:23:11 If there is among you any man who is not clean by reason of that which happens him by night, then shall he go outside of the camp. He shall not come within the camp: 
verse:23:12 but it shall be, when evening comes on, he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun is down, he shall come within the camp. 
verse:23:13 You shall have a place also outside of the camp, where you shall go forth abroad: 
verse:23:14 and you shall have a paddle among your weapons; and it shall be, when you sit down abroad, you shall dig therewith, and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you: 
verse:23:15 for HASHEM your God walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you; therefore your camp shall be holy, that he may not see an unclean thing in you, and turn away from you. 
verse:23:16 You shall not deliver to his master a servant who is escaped from his master to you: 
verse:23:17 he shall dwell with you, in the midst of you, in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates, where it pleases him best: you shall not oppress him. 
verse:23:18 There shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel. 
verse:23:19 You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute, or the wages of a dog, into the house of HASHEM your God for any vow: for even both these are an abomination to HASHEM your God. 
verse:23:20 You shall not lend on interest to your brother; interest of money, interest of food, interest of anything that is lent on interest: 
verse:23:21 to a foreigner you may lend on interest; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest, that HASHEM your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to, in the land where you go in to possess it. 
verse:23:22 When you shall vow a vow to HASHEM your God, you shall not be slack to pay it: for HASHEM your God will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you. 
verse:23:23 But if you shall forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in you. 
verse:23:24 That which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; according as you have vowed to HASHEM your God, a freewill offering, which you have promised with your mouth. 
verse:23:25 When you come into your neighbor's vineyard, then you may eat of grapes your fill at your own pleasure; but you shall not put any in your vessel. 
verse:23:26 When you come into your neighbor's standing grain, then you may pluck the ears with your hand; but you shall not move a sickle to your neighbor's standing grain.
verse:24:1 When a man takes a wife, and marries her, then it shall be, if she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house. 
verse:24:2 When she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife. 
verse:24:3 If the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife; 
verse:24:4 her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before HASHEM: and you shall not cause the land to sin, which HASHEM your God gives you for an inheritance. 
verse:24:5 When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out in the army, neither shall he be assigned any business: he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he has taken. 
verse:24:6 No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he takes a life in pledge. 
verse:24:7 If a man be found stealing any of his brothers of the children of Israel, and he deal with him as a slave, or sell him; then that thief shall die: so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you. 
verse:24:8 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that you observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so you shall observe to do. 
verse:24:9 Remember what HASHEM your God did to Miriam, by the way as you came forth out of Egypt. 
verse:24:10 When you do lend your neighbor any kind of loan, you shall not go into his house to get his pledge. 
verse:24:11 You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you do lend shall bring forth the pledge outside to you. 
verse:24:12 If he be a poor man, you shall not sleep with his pledge; 
verse:24:13 you shall surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you: and it shall be righteousness to you before HASHEM your God. 
verse:24:14 You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he be of your brothers, or of your foreigners who are in your land within your gates: 
verse:24:15 in his day you shall give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down on it; for he is poor, and sets his heart on it: lest he cry against you to HASHEM, and it be sin to you. 
verse:24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin. 
verse:24:17 You shall not deprive the foreigner, or the fatherless of justice, nor take a widow's clothing in pledge; 
verse:24:18 but you shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt, and HASHEM your God redeemed you there: therefore I command you to do this thing. 
verse:24:19 When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgot a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to get it: it shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that HASHEM your God may bless you in all the work of your hands. 
verse:24:20 When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow. 
verse:24:21 When you harvest your vineyard, you shall not glean it after yourselves: it shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow. 
verse:24:22 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land of Egypt: therefore I command you to do this thing.
verse:25:1 If there is a controversy between men, and they come to judgment, and the judges judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked; 
verse:25:2 and it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his wickedness, by number. 
verse:25:3 Forty stripes he may give him, he shall not exceed; lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then your brother should seem vile to you. 
verse:25:4 You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out the grain. 
verse:25:5 If brothers dwell together, and one of them die, and have no son, the wife of the dead shall not be married outside to a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in to her, and take her to him as wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her. 
verse:25:6 It shall be, that the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead, that his name not be blotted out of Israel.
verse:25:7 If the man doesn't want to take his brother's wife, then his brother's wife shall go up to the gate to the elders, and say, "My husband's brother refuses to raise up to his brother a name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a husband's brother to me." 
verse:25:8 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak to him: and if he stand, and say, "I don't want to take her;" 
verse:25:9 then his brother's wife shall come to him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face; and she shall answer and say, "So shall it be done to the man who does not build up his brother's house." 
verse:25:10 His name shall be called in Israel, The house of him who has his shoe untied.
verse:25:11 When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him who strikes him, and puts forth her hand, and takes him by the secrets; 
verse:25:12 then you shall cut off her hand, your eye shall have no pity.
verse:25:13 You shall not have in your bag diverse weights, a great and a small. 
verse:25:14 You shall not have in your house diverse measures, a great and a small. 
verse:25:15 You shall have a perfect and just weight. You shall have a perfect and just measure, that your days may be long in the land which HASHEM your God gives you. 
verse:25:16 For all who do such things, all who do unrighteously, are an abomination to HASHEM your God. 
verse:25:17 Remember what Amalek did to you by the way as you came forth out of Egypt; 
verse:25:18 how he met you by the way, and struck the hindmost of you, all who were feeble behind you, when you were faint and weary; and he didn't fear God. 
verse:25:19 Therefore it shall be, when HASHEM your God has given you rest from all your enemies all around, in the land which HASHEM your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it, that you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky; you shall not forget.
portion:Deuteronomy 26:1 - 29:8
verse:26:1 It shall be, when you have come in to the land which HASHEM your God gives you for an inheritance, and possess it, and dwell therein, 
verse:26:2 that you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you shall bring in from your land that HASHEM your God gives you; and you shall put it in a basket, and shall go to the place which HASHEM your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there. 
verse:26:3 You shall come to the priest who shall be in those days, and tell him, "I profess this day to HASHEM your God, that I am come to the land which HASHEM swore to our fathers to give us." 
verse:26:4 The priest shall take the basket out of your hand, and set it down before the altar of HASHEM your God. 
verse:26:5 You shall answer and say before HASHEM your God, "A Syrian ready to perish was my father; and he went down into Egypt, and lived there, few in number; and he became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous. 
verse:26:6 The Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid on us hard bondage: 
verse:26:7 and we cried to HASHEM, the God of our fathers, and HASHEM heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression; 
verse:26:8 and HASHEM brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror, and with signs, and with wonders; 
verse:26:9 and he has brought us into this place, and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
verse:26:10 Now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground, which you, HASHEM, have given me." You shall set it down before HASHEM your God, and worship before HASHEM your God. 
verse:26:11 You shall rejoice in all the good which HASHEM your God has given to you, and to your house, you, and the Levite, and the foreigner who is in the midst of you.
verse:26:12 When you have made an end of tithing all the tithe of your increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing, then you shall give it to the Levite, to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within your gates, and be filled. 
verse:26:13 You shall say before HASHEM your God, "I have put away the holy things out of my house, and also have given them to the Levite, and to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all your commandment which you have commanded me: I have not transgressed any of your commandments, neither have I forgotten them: 
verse:26:14 I have not eaten of it in my mourning, neither have I put away of it, being unclean, nor given of it for the dead: I have listened to the voice of HASHEM my God; I have done according to all that you have commanded me. 
verse:26:15 Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless your people Israel, and the ground which you have given us, as you swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey."
verse:26:16 This day HASHEM your God commands you to do these statutes and ordinances: you shall therefore keep and do them with all your heart, and with all your soul. 
verse:26:17 You have declared HASHEM this day to be your God, and that you would walk in his ways, and keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and listen to his voice: 
verse:26:18 and HASHEM has declared you this day to be a people for his own possession, as he has promised you, and that you should keep all his commandments; 
verse:26:19 and to make you high above all nations that he has made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that you may be a holy people to HASHEM your God, as he has spoken.
verse:27:1 Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, "Keep all the commandment which I command you this day. 
verse:27:2 It shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which HASHEM your God gives you, that you shall set yourself up great stones, and plaster them with plaster: 
verse:27:3 and you shall write on them all the words of this law, when you have passed over; that you may go in to the land which HASHEM your God gives you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as HASHEM, the God of your fathers, has promised you. 
verse:27:4 It shall be, when you have passed over the Jordan, that you shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in Mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster. 
verse:27:5 There you shall build an altar to HASHEM your God, an altar of stones: you shall lift up no iron on them. 
verse:27:6 You shall build the altar of HASHEM your God of uncut stones; and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon to HASHEM your God: 
verse:27:7 and you shall sacrifice peace offerings, and shall eat there; and you shall rejoice before HASHEM your God. 
verse:27:8 You shall write on the stones all the words of this law very plainly."
verse:27:9 Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying, "Keep silence, and listen, Israel: this day you have become the people of HASHEM your God. 
verse:27:10 You shall therefore obey the voice of HASHEM your God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command you this day."
verse:27:11 Moses commanded the people the same day, saying, 
verse:27:12 "These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people, when you have passed over the Jordan: Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin. 
verse:27:13 These shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. 
verse:27:14 The Levites shall answer, and tell all the men of Israel with a loud voice, 
verse:27:15 'Cursed is the man who makes an engraved or molten image, an abomination to HASHEM, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret.' All the people shall answer and say, 'Amen.' 
verse:27:16 'Cursed is he who sets light by his father or his mother.' All the people shall say, 'Amen.' 
verse:27:17 'Cursed is he who removes his neighbor's landmark.' All the people shall say, 'Amen.' 
verse:27:18 'Cursed is he who makes the blind to wander out of the way.' All the people shall say, 'Amen.' 
verse:27:19 'Cursed is he who the foreigner, fatherless, and widow of justice.' All the people shall say, 'Amen.' 
verse:27:20 'Cursed is he who lies with his father's wife, because he has uncovered his father's skirt.' All the people shall say, 'Amen.' 
verse:27:21 'Cursed is he who lies with any kind of animal.' All the people shall say, 'Amen.' 
verse:27:22 'Cursed is he who lies with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother.' All the people shall say, 'Amen.' 
verse:27:23 'Cursed is he who lies with his mother-in-law.' All the people shall say, 'Amen.' 
verse:27:24 'Cursed is he who strikes his neighbor in secret.' All the people shall say, 'Amen.' 
verse:27:25 'Cursed is he who takes a bribe to kill an innocent person.' All the people shall say, 'Amen.' 
verse:27:26 'Cursed is he who doesn't confirm the words of this law to do them.' All the people shall say, 'Amen.'"
verse:28:1 It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to the voice of HASHEM your God, to observe to do all his commandments which I command you this day, that HASHEM your God will set you on high above all the nations of the earth: 
verse:28:2 and all these blessings shall come on you, and overtake you, if you shall listen to the voice of HASHEM your God. 
verse:28:3 You shall be blessed in the city, and you shall be blessed in the field. 
verse:28:4 You shall be blessed in the fruit of your body, the fruit of your ground, the fruit of your animals, the increase of your livestock, and the young of your flock. 
verse:28:5 Your basket and your kneading trough shall be blessed. 
verse:28:6 You shall be blessed when you come in, and you shall be blessed when you go out. 
verse:28:7 HASHEM will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be struck before you. They will come out against you one way, and will flee before you seven ways. 
verse:28:8 HASHEM will command the blessing on you in your barns, and in all that you put your hand to; and he will bless you in the land which HASHEM your God gives you. 
verse:28:9 HASHEM will establish you for a holy people to himself, as he has sworn to you; if you shall keep the commandments of HASHEM your God, and walk in his ways. 
verse:28:10 All the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of HASHEM; and they shall be afraid of you. 
verse:28:11 HASHEM will make you plenteous for good, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, in the land which HASHEM swore to your fathers to give you. 
verse:28:12 HASHEM will open to you his good treasure in the sky, to give the rain of your land in its season, and to bless all the work of your hand: and you shall lend to many nations, and you shall not borrow. 
verse:28:13 HASHEM will make you the head, and not the tail; and you shall be above only, and you shall not be beneath; if you shall listen to the commandments of HASHEM your God, which I command you this day, to observe and to do, 
verse:28:14 and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them. 
verse:28:15 But it shall come to pass, if you will not listen to the voice of HASHEM your God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day, that all these curses shall come on you, and overtake you. 
verse:28:16 You shall be cursed in the city, and you shall be cursed in the field. 
verse:28:17 Your basket and your kneading trough shall be cursed. 
verse:28:18 The fruit of your body, the fruit of your ground, the increase of your livestock, and the young of your flock shall be cursed. 
verse:28:19 You shall be cursed when you come in, and you shall be cursed when you go out. 
verse:28:20 HASHEM will send on you cursing, confusion, and rebuke, in all that you put your hand to do, until you are destroyed, and until you perish quickly; because of the evil of your doings, by which you have forsaken me. 
verse:28:21 HASHEM will make the pestilence cling to you, until he has consumed you from off the land, where you go in to possess it. 
verse:28:22 HASHEM will strike you with consumption, and with fever, and with inflammation, and with fiery heat, and with the sword, and with blight, and with mildew; and they shall pursue you until you perish. 
verse:28:23 Your sky that is over your head shall be brass, and the earth that is under you shall be iron. 
verse:28:24 HASHEM will make the rain of your land powder and dust: from the sky shall it come down on you, until you are destroyed. 
verse:28:25 HASHEM will cause you to be struck before your enemies; you shall go out one way against them, and shall flee seven ways before them: and you shall be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth. 
verse:28:26 Your dead body shall be food to all birds of the sky, and to the animals of the earth; and there shall be none to frighten them away. 
verse:28:27 HASHEM will strike you with the boil of Egypt, and with the tumors, and with the scurvy, and with the itch, of which you can not be healed. 
verse:28:28 HASHEM will strike you with madness, and with blindness, and with astonishment of heart; 
verse:28:29 and you shall grope at noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways: and you shall be only oppressed and robbed always, and there shall be none to save you. 
verse:28:30 You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: you shall build a house, and you shall not dwell therein: you shall plant a vineyard, and shall not use its fruit. 
verse:28:31 Your ox shall be slain before your eyes, and you shall not eat of it: your donkey shall be violently taken away from before your face, and shall not be restored to you: your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and you shall have none to save you. 
verse:28:32 Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people; and your eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day: and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand. 
verse:28:33 The fruit of your ground, and all your labors, shall a nation which you don't know eat up; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed always; 
verse:28:34 so that you shall be mad for the sight of your eyes which you shall see. 
verse:28:35 HASHEM will strike you in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore boil, of which you can not be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head. 
verse:28:36 HASHEM will bring you, and your king whom you shall set over you, to a nation that you have not known, you nor your fathers; and there you shall serve other gods, wood and stone. 
verse:28:37 You shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples where HASHEM shall lead you away. 
verse:28:38 You shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather little in; for the locust shall consume it. 
verse:28:39 You shall plant vineyards and dress them, but you shall neither drink of the wine, nor harvest; for the worm shall eat them. 
verse:28:40 You shall have olive trees throughout all your borders, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olives shall drop off. 
verse:28:41 You shall father sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours; for they shall go into captivity. 
verse:28:42 All your trees and the fruit of your ground shall the locust possess. 
verse:28:43 The foreigner who is in the midst of you shall mount up above you higher and higher; and you shall come down lower and lower. 
verse:28:44 He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him: he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail. 
verse:28:45 All these curses shall come on you, and shall pursue you, and overtake you, until you are destroyed; because you didn't listen to the voice of HASHEM your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you: 
verse:28:46 and they shall be on you for a sign and for a wonder, and on your seed forever. 
verse:28:47 Because you didn't serve HASHEM your God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things; 
verse:28:48 therefore you shall serve your enemies whom HASHEM shall send against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron on your neck, until he has destroyed you. 
verse:28:49 HASHEM will bring a nation against you from far, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flies; a nation whose language you shall not understand; 
verse:28:50 a nation of fierce facial expressions, that shall not respect the person of the old, nor show favor to the young, 
verse:28:51 and shall eat the fruit of your livestock, and the fruit of your ground, until you are destroyed; that also shall not leave you grain, new wine, or oil, the increase of your livestock, or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish. 
verse:28:52 They shall besiege you in all your gates, until your high and fortified walls come down, in which you trusted, throughout all your land; and they shall besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land, which HASHEM your God has given you. 
verse:28:53 You shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, whom HASHEM your God has given you, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies shall distress you. 
verse:28:54 The man who is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining; 
verse:28:55 so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat, because he has nothing left him, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates. 
verse:28:56 The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter, 
verse:28:57 and toward her young one who comes out from between her feet, and toward her children whom she shall bear; for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in your gates. 
verse:28:58 If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, THE HASHEM YOUR GOD; 
verse:28:59 then HASHEM will make your plagues wonderful, and the plagues of your seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and severe sicknesses, and of long continuance. 
verse:28:60 He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they shall cling to you. 
verse:28:61 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, HASHEM will bring them on you, until you are destroyed. 
verse:28:62 You shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars of the sky for multitude; because you didn't listen to the voice of HASHEM your God. 
verse:28:63 It shall happen that as HASHEM rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so HASHEM will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you; and you shall be plucked from off the land where you go in to possess it. 
verse:28:64 HASHEM will scatter you among all peoples, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth; and there you shall serve other gods, which you have not known, you nor your fathers, even wood and stone. 
verse:28:65 Among these nations you shall find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot: but HASHEM will give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and pining of soul; 
verse:28:66 and your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall fear night and day, and shall have no assurance of your life. 
verse:28:67 In the morning you shall say, "I wish it were evening!" and at evening you shall say, "I wish it were morning!" for the fear of your heart which you shall fear, and for the sight of your eyes which you shall see. 
verse:28:68 HASHEM will bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way of which I said to you, You shall see it no more again: and there you shall sell yourselves to your enemies for bondservants and for bondmaids, and no man shall buy you.
verse:28:69 These are the words of the covenant which HASHEM commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb. 
verse:29:1 Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, You have seen all that HASHEM did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land; 
verse:29:2 the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders: 
verse:29:3 but HASHEM has not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day. 
verse:29:4 I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes have not grown old on you, and your shoes have not grown old on your feet. 
verse:29:5 You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink; that you may know that I am HASHEM your God. 
verse:29:6 When you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us to battle, and we struck them: 
verse:29:7 and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites. 
verse:29:8 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.
portion:Deuteronomy 29:9 - 30:20
verse:29:9 You stand this day all of you before HASHEM your God; your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel, 
verse:29:10 your little ones, your wives, and your foreigner who is in the midst of your camps, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water; 
verse:29:11 that you may enter into the covenant of HASHEM your God, and into his oath, which HASHEM your God makes with you this day; 
verse:29:12 that he may establish you this day to himself for a people, and that he may be to you a God, as he spoke to you, and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
verse:29:13 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath, 
verse:29:14 but with him who stands here with us this day before HASHEM our God, and also with him who is not here with us this day 
verse:29:15 (for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed; 
verse:29:16 and you have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them); 
verse:29:17 lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from HASHEM our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood; 
verse:29:18 and it happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, "I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry." 
verse:29:19 HASHEM will not pardon him, but then the anger of HASHEM and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie on him, and HASHEM will blot out his name from under the sky. 
verse:29:20 HASHEM will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this scroll of the Torah.
verse:29:21 The generation to come, your children who shall rise up after you, and the foreigner who shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses with which HASHEM has made it sick; 
verse:29:22 and that the whole land of it is sulfur, salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which HASHEM overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: 
verse:29:23 even all the nations shall say, "Why has HASHEM done thus to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?"
verse:29:24 Then men shall say, "Because they forsook the covenant of HASHEM, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, 
verse:29:25 and went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods that they didn't know, and that he had not given to them: 
verse:29:26 therefore the anger of HASHEM was kindled against this land, to bring on it all the curse that is written in this book; 
verse:29:27 and HASHEM rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day."
verse:29:28 The secret things belong to HASHEM our God; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.
verse:30:1 It shall happen, when all these things have come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the nations, where HASHEM your God has driven you, 
verse:30:2 and shall return to HASHEM your God, and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day, you and your children, with all your heart, and with all your soul; 
verse:30:3 that then HASHEM your God will turn your captivity, and have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the peoples, where HASHEM your God has scattered you. 
verse:30:4 If your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens, from there will HASHEM your God gather you, and from there he will bring you back: 
verse:30:5 and HASHEM your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and he will do you good, and multiply you above your fathers. 
verse:30:6 HASHEM your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love HASHEM your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live. 
verse:30:7 HASHEM your God will put all these curses on your enemies, and on those who hate you, who persecuted you. 
verse:30:8 You shall return and obey the voice of HASHEM, and do all his commandments which I command you this day. 
verse:30:9 HASHEM your God will make you plenteous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, for good: for HASHEM will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced over your fathers; 
verse:30:10 if you shall obey the voice of HASHEM your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this scroll of the Torah; if you turn to HASHEM your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.
verse:30:11 For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not too hard for you, neither is it far off. 
verse:30:12 It is not in heaven, that you should say, "Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?" 
verse:30:13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, "Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?" 
verse:30:14 But the word is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it. 
verse:30:15 Behold, I have set before you this day life and good, and death and evil; 
verse:30:16 in that I command you this day to love HASHEM your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, that you may live and multiply, and that HASHEM your God may bless you in the land where you go in to possess it. 
verse:30:17 But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but shall be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; 
verse:30:18 I denounce to you this day, that you shall surely perish; you shall not prolong your days in the land, where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it. 
verse:30:19 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your seed; 
verse:30:20 to love HASHEM your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; for he is your life, and the length of your days; that you may dwell in the land which HASHEM swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.
portion:Deuteronomy 31:1 - 31:30
verse:31:1 Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. 
verse:31:2 He said to them, "I am one hundred twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: and HASHEM has said to me, 'You shall not go over this Jordan.' 
verse:31:3 HASHEM your God, he will go over before you; he will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua shall go over before you, as HASHEM has spoken. 
verse:31:4 HASHEM will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land; whom he destroyed. 
verse:31:5 HASHEM will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you. 
verse:31:6 Be strong and courageous, don't be afraid, nor be scared of them: for HASHEM your God, he it is who does go with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you."
verse:31:7 Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous: for you shall go with this people into the land which HASHEM has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it. 
verse:31:8 HASHEM, he it is who does go before you; he will be with you, he will not fail you, neither forsake you: don't be afraid, neither be dismayed."
verse:31:9 Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of HASHEM, and to all the elders of Israel. 
verse:31:10 Moses commanded them, saying, "At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of booths, 
verse:31:11 when all Israel has come to appear before HASHEM your God in the place which he shall choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing. 
verse:31:12 Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and your foreigner who is within your gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear HASHEM your God, and observe to do all the words of this law; 
verse:31:13 and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and learn to fear HASHEM your God, as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it."
verse:31:14 HASHEM said to Moses, "Behold, your days approach that you must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, that I may commission him." Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting.
verse:31:15 HASHEM appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent. 
verse:31:16 HASHEM said to Moses, "Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and play the prostitute after the strange gods of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them. 
verse:31:17 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come on them; so that they will say in that day, 'Haven't these evils come on us because our God is not among us?' 
verse:31:18 I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have worked, in that they are turned to other gods.
verse:31:19 "Now therefore write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel. 
verse:31:20 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant. 
verse:31:21 It shall happen, when many evils and troubles have come on them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I swore." 
verse:31:22 So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
verse:31:23 He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, "Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with you."
verse:31:24 It happened, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, 
verse:31:25 that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of HASHEM, saying, 
verse:31:26 "Take this scroll of the Torah, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of HASHEM your God, that it may be there for a witness against you. 
verse:31:27 For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against HASHEM; and how much more after my death? 
verse:31:28 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them. 
verse:31:29 For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days; because you will do that which is evil in the sight of HASHEM, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands."
verse:31:30 Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.
portion:Deuteronomy 32:1 - 32:52
verse:32:1 Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak. Let the earth hear the words of my mouth. 
verse:32:2 My doctrine shall drop as the rain. My speech shall condense as the dew, as the small rain on the tender grass, as the showers on the herb. 
verse:32:3 For I will proclaim the name of HASHEM. Ascribe greatness to our God! 
verse:32:4 The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are justice: a God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is he. 
verse:32:5 They have dealt corruptly with him. They are not his children,  because of their defect. They are a perverse and crooked generation. 
verse:32:6 Do you thus requite HASHEM, foolish people and unwise? Isn't he your father who has bought you? He has made you, and established you. 
verse:32:7 Remember the days of old. Consider the years of many generations. Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you. 
verse:32:8 When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the children of men, he set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel. 
verse:32:9 For HASHEM's portion is his people. Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. 
verse:32:10 He found him in a desert land, in the waste howling wilderness. He surrounded him. He cared for him. He kept him as the apple of his eye. 
verse:32:11 As an eagle that stirs up her nest, that flutters over her young, he spread abroad his wings, he took them, he bore them on his feathers. 
verse:32:12 HASHEM alone led him. There was no foreign god with him. 
verse:32:13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth. He ate the increase of the field. He caused him to suck honey out of the rock, oil out of the flinty rock; 
verse:32:14 Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the finest of the wheat. Of the blood of the grape you drank wine. 
verse:32:15 But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked. You have grown fat. You have grown thick. You have become sleek. Then he forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation. 
verse:32:16 They moved him to jealousy with strange gods. They provoked him to anger with abominations. 
verse:32:17 They sacrificed to demons, not God, to gods that they didn't know, to new gods that came up recently, which your fathers didn't dread. 
verse:32:18 Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful, and have forgotten God who gave you birth. 
verse:32:19 HASHEM saw and abhorred, because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters. 
verse:32:20 He said, "I will hide my face from them. I will see what their end shall be; for they are a very perverse generation, children in whom is no faithfulness. 
verse:32:21 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God. They have provoked me to anger with their vanities. I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people. I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. 
verse:32:22 For a fire is kindled in my anger, Burns to the lowest Sheol, Devours the earth with its increase, and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire.  
verse:32:23 "I will heap evils on them. I will spend my arrows on them. 
verse:32:24 They shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat and bitter destruction. I will send the teeth of animals on them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust. 
verse:32:25 Outside the sword shall bereave, and in the rooms, terror; on both young man and virgin, The nursing infant with the gray-haired man. 
verse:32:26 I said, I would scatter them afar. I would make their memory to cease from among men; 
verse:32:27 were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, lest their adversaries should judge wrongly, lest they should say, 'Our hand is exalted, HASHEM has not done all this.'"  
verse:32:28 For they are a nation void of counsel. There is no understanding in them. 
verse:32:29 Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end! 
verse:32:30 How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and HASHEM had delivered them up? 
verse:32:31 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges. 
verse:32:32 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, of the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter. 
verse:32:33 Their wine is the poison of serpents, The cruel venom of asps.  
verse:32:34 "Isn't this laid up in store with me, sealed up among my treasures? 
verse:32:35 Vengeance is mine, and recompense, at the time when their foot slides; for the day of their calamity is at hand. The things that are to come on them shall make haste."  
verse:32:36 For HASHEM will judge his people, and have compassion on his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, There is none remaining, shut up or left at large. 
verse:32:37 He will say, "Where are their gods, The rock in which they took refuge; 
verse:32:38 Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you! Let them be your protection.  
verse:32:39 "See now that I, even I, am he, There is no god with me. I kill, and I make alive. I wound, and I heal. There is no one who can deliver out of my hand. 
verse:32:40 For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live forever, 
verse:32:41 if I whet my glittering sword, My hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my adversaries, and will recompense those who hate me. 
verse:32:42 I will make my arrows drunk with blood. My sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the  captives, from the head of the leaders of the enemy."  
verse:32:43 Rejoice, you nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants. He will render vengeance to his adversaries, And will make expiation for his land, for his people.
verse:32:44 Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun. 
verse:32:45 Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel; 
verse:32:46 He said to them, "Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you this day, which you shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law. 
verse:32:47 For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it."
verse:32:48 HASHEM spoke to Moses that same day, saying, 
verse:32:49 "Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession; 
verse:32:50 and die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people: 
verse:32:51 because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn't sanctify me in the midst of the children of Israel. 
verse:32:52 For you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel."
portion:Deuteronomy 33:1 - 34:12; Genesis 1:1 - 2:3
verse:33:1 This is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death. 
verse:33:2 He said, "HASHEM came from Sinai, And rose from Seir to them. He shone forth from Mount Paran. He came from the ten thousands of holy ones. At his right hand was a fiery law for them. 
verse:33:3 Yes, he loves the people. All his holy ones are in your hand. They sat down at your feet; each receives your words. 
verse:33:4 Moses commanded us a law, An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob. 
verse:33:5 He was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered, All the tribes of Israel together.  
verse:33:6 "Let Reuben live, and not die; Nor let his men be few."
verse:33:7 This is for Judah. He said, "Hear, HASHEM, the voice of Judah. Bring him in to his people. With his hands he contended for himself. You shall be a help against his adversaries."
verse:33:8 Of Levi he said, "Your Thummim and your Urim are with your godly one, whom you proved at Massah, with whom you strove at the waters of Meribah; 
verse:33:9 who said of his father, and of his mother, 'I have not seen him;' Neither did he acknowledge his brothers, Nor did he know his own children: For they have observed your word, and keep your covenant. 
verse:33:10 They shall teach Jacob your ordinances, and Israel your law. They shall put incense before you, and whole burnt offering on your altar. 
verse:33:11 HASHEM, bless his substance. Accept the work of his hands. Strike through the hips of those who rise up against him, of those who hate him, that they not rise again."
verse:33:12 Of Benjamin he said, "The beloved of HASHEM shall dwell in safety by him. He covers him all the day long. He dwells between his shoulders."
verse:33:13 Of Joseph he said, "His land is blessed by HASHEM, for the precious things of the heavens, for the dew, for the deep that couches beneath, 
verse:33:14 for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, for the precious things of the growth of the moons, 
verse:33:15 for the chief things of the ancient mountains, for the precious things of the everlasting hills, 
verse:33:16 for the precious things of the earth and its fullness, the good will of him who lived in the bush. Let this come on the head of Joseph, on the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers. 
verse:33:17 The firstborn of his herd, majesty is his. His horns are the horns of the wild ox. With them he shall push all of the peoples, to the ends of the earth: They are the ten thousands of Ephraim. They are the thousands of Manasseh."
verse:33:18 Of Zebulun he said, "Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and Issachar, in your tents. 
verse:33:19 They shall call the peoples to the mountain. There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness, for they shall draw out the abundance of the seas, the hidden treasures of the sand."
verse:33:20 Of Gad he said, "He who enlarges Gad is blessed. He dwells as a lioness, and tears the arm, yes, the crown of the head. 
verse:33:21 He provided the first part for himself, for there was the lawgiver's portion reserved. He came with the heads of the people. He executed the righteousness of HASHEM, His ordinances with Israel."
verse:33:22 Of Dan he said, "Dan is a lion's cub that leaps out of Bashan."
verse:33:23 Of Naphtali he said, "Naphtali, satisfied with favor, full of the blessing of HASHEM, Possess the west and the south."
verse:33:24 Of Asher he said, "Asher is blessed with children. Let him be acceptable to his brothers. Let him dip his foot in oil. 
verse:33:25 Your bars shall be iron and brass. As your days, so your strength will be.  
verse:33:26 "There is none like God, Jeshurun, who rides on the heavens for your help, In his excellency on the skies. 
verse:33:27 The eternal God is your dwelling place. Underneath are the everlasting arms. He thrust out the enemy from before you, and said, 'Destroy!' 
verse:33:28 Israel dwells in safety; the fountain of Jacob alone, In a land of grain and new wine. Yes, his heavens drop down dew. 
verse:33:29 You are happy, Israel. Who is like you, a people saved by HASHEM, the shield of your help, the sword of your excellency! Your enemies shall submit themselves to you. You shall tread on their high places."
verse:34:1 Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. HASHEM showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan, 
verse:34:2 and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the hinder sea, 
verse:34:3 and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, to Zoar. 
verse:34:4 HASHEM said to him, "This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your seed.' I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there."
verse:34:5 So Moses the servant of HASHEM died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of HASHEM. 
verse:34:6 He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth Peor: but no man knows of his tomb to this day. 
verse:34:7 Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. 
verse:34:8 The children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended. 
verse:34:9 Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands on him: and the children of Israel listened to him, and did as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:34:10 There has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom HASHEM knew face to face, 
verse:34:11 in all the signs and the wonders, which HASHEM sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, 
verse:34:12 and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses worked in the sight of all Israel. 
Bereshit
verse:1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 
verse:1:2 Now the earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep. God's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.
verse:1:3 God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. 
verse:1:4 God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness. 
verse:1:5 God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." There was evening and there was morning, one day.
verse:1:6 God said, "Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters." 
verse:1:7 God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so. 
verse:1:8 God called the expanse "sky." There was evening and there was morning, a second day.
verse:1:9 God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;" and it was so. 
verse:1:10 God called the dry land "earth," and the gathering together of the waters he called "seas." God saw that it was good. 
verse:1:11 God said, "Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed in it, on the earth;" and it was so. 
verse:1:12 The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. 
verse:1:13 There was evening and there was morning, a third day.
verse:1:14 God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years; 
verse:1:15 and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth;" and it was so. 
verse:1:16 God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars. 
verse:1:17 God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth, 
verse:1:18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good. 
verse:1:19 There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
verse:1:20 God said, "Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky." 
verse:1:21 God created the large sea creatures, and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good. 
verse:1:22 God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth." 
verse:1:23 There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
verse:1:24 God said, "Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind;" and it was so. 
verse:1:25 God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good.
verse:1:26 God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth." 
verse:1:27 God created man in his own image. In God's image he created him; male and female he created them. 
verse:1:28 God blessed them. God said to them, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth." 
verse:1:29 God said, "Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food. 
verse:1:30 To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food;" and it was so.
verse:1:31 God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.
verse:2:1 The heavens and the earth were finished, and all their vast array. 
verse:2:2 On the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 
verse:2:3 God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested in it from all his work which he had created and made.

portion:Genesis 2:4 - 2:19
verse:2:4 This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that HASHEM God made the earth and the heavens. 
verse:2:5 No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for HASHEM God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a man to till the ground, 
verse:2:6 but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground. 
verse:2:7 HASHEM God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. 
verse:2:8 HASHEM God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed. 
verse:2:9 Out of the ground HASHEM God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. 
verse:2:10 A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became four heads. 
verse:2:11 The name of the first is Pishon: this is the one which flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 
verse:2:12 and the gold of that land is good. There is aromatic resin and the onyx stone. 
verse:2:13 The name of the second river is Gihon: the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush. 
verse:2:14 The name of the third river is Hiddekel: this is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates. 
verse:2:15 HASHEM God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. 
verse:2:16 HASHEM God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; 
verse:2:17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die."
verse:2:18 HASHEM God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him." 
verse:2:19 Out of the ground HASHEM God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.
portion:Genesis 2:20 - 3:21
verse:2:20 The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper suitable for him. 
verse:2:21 HASHEM God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. 
verse:2:22 He made the rib, which HASHEM God had taken from the man, into a woman, and brought her to the man. 
verse:2:23 The man said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called 'woman,' because she was taken out of Man." 
verse:2:24 Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh. 
verse:2:25 They were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
verse:3:1 Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which HASHEM God had made. He said to the woman, "Has God really said, 'You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?'"
verse:3:2 The woman said to the serpent, "Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat, 
verse:3:3 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'"
verse:3:4 The serpent said to the woman, "You won't surely die, 
verse:3:5 for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
verse:3:6 When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit, and ate; and she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate. 
verse:3:7 The eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. 
verse:3:8 They heard the voice of HASHEM God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of HASHEM God among the trees of the garden.
verse:3:9 HASHEM God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?"
verse:3:10 The man said, "I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."
verse:3:11 God said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"
verse:3:12 The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate."
verse:3:13 HASHEM God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?"
The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
verse:3:14 HASHEM God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, you are cursed above all livestock, and above every animal of the field. On your belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life. 
verse:3:15 I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel."
verse:3:16 To the woman he said, "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth. In pain you will bear children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."
verse:3:17 To Adam he said, "Because you have listened to your wife's voice, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground for your sake. In toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. 
verse:3:18 It will yield thorns and thistles to you; and you will eat the herb of the field. 
verse:3:19 By the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For you are dust, and to dust you shall return."
verse:3:20 The man called his wife Havah, because she was the mother of all living. 
verse:3:21 HASHEM God made coats of skins for Adam and for his wife, and clothed them.
portion:Genesis 3:22 - 4:18
verse:3:22 HASHEM God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever..." 
verse:3:23 Therefore HASHEM God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken. 
verse:3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed Cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.
verse:4:1 The man knew Havah his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Cain, and said, "I have gotten a man with HASHEM's help." 
verse:4:2 Again she gave birth, to Cain's brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 
verse:4:3 As time passed, it happened that Cain brought an offering to HASHEM from the fruit of the ground. 
verse:4:4 Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. HASHEM respected Abel and his offering, 
verse:4:5 but he didn't respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell. 
verse:4:6 HASHEM said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen? 
verse:4:7 If you do well, will it not be lifted up? If you don't do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it." 
verse:4:8 Cain said to Abel, his brother, "Let's go into the field." It happened when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.
verse:4:9 HASHEM said to Cain, "Where is Abel, your brother?"
He said, "I don't know. Am I my brother's keeper?"
verse:4:10 HASHEM said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground. 
verse:4:11 Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. 
verse:4:12 From now on, when you till the ground, it won't yield its strength to you. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth."
verse:4:13 Cain said to HASHEM, "My punishment is greater than I can bear. 
verse:4:14 Behold, you have driven me out this day from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. It will happen that whoever finds me will kill me."
verse:4:15 HASHEM said to him, "Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold." HASHEM appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should strike him.

verse:4:25 Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, "for God has appointed me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him." 
verse:4:26 There was also born a son to Seth, and he named him Enosh. Then men began to call on HASHEM's name.

verse:6:9 This is the history of the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time. Noah walked with God. 
verse:6:10 Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
verse:6:11 The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 
verse:6:12 God saw the earth, and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.
verse:6:13 God said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 
verse:6:14 Make a ship of gopher wood. You shall make rooms in the ship, and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch. 
verse:6:15 This is how you shall make it. The length of the ship will be three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. 
verse:6:16 You shall make a roof in the ship, and you shall finish it to a cubit upward. You shall set the door of the ship in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels. 
verse:6:17 I, even I, do bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky. Everything that is in the earth will die. 
verse:6:18 But I will establish my covenant with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you. 
verse:6:19 Of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female.

verse:6:21 Take with you of all food that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it will be for food for you, and for them." 
verse:6:22 Thus Noah did. According to all that God commanded him, so he did.
portion:Genesis 7:1 - 7:16
verse:7:1 HASHEM said to Noah, "Come with all of your household into the ship, for I have seen your righteousness before me in this generation. 
verse:7:2 You shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you, the male and his female. Of the animals that are not clean, take two, the male and his female. 
verse:7:3 Also of the birds of the sky, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth. 
verse:7:4 In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights. Every living thing that I have made, I will destroy from the surface of the ground."
verse:7:5 Noah did everything that HASHEM commanded him.
verse:7:6 Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth. 
verse:7:7 Noah went into the ship with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives, because of the waters of the flood. 
verse:7:8 Clean animals, animals that are not clean, birds, and everything that creeps on the ground 
verse:7:9 went by pairs to Noah into the ship, male and female, as God commanded Noah. 
verse:7:10 It happened after the seven days, that the waters of the flood came on the earth. 
verse:7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep were burst open, and the sky's windows were opened. 
verse:7:12 The rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights.
verse:7:13 In the same day Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ship; 
verse:7:14 they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort. 
verse:7:15 They went to Noah into the ship, by pairs of all flesh with the breath of life in them. 
verse:7:16 Those who went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him; and HASHEM shut him in.
portion:Genesis 7:17 - 8:14
verse:7:17 The flood was forty days on the earth. The waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth. 
verse:7:18 The waters prevailed, and increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters. 
verse:7:19 The waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth. All the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered. 
verse:7:20 The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered. 
verse:7:21 All flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man. 
verse:7:22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died. 
verse:7:23 Every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were destroyed from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship. 
verse:7:24 The waters prevailed on the earth one hundred fifty days.
verse:8:1 God remembered Noah, all the animals, and all the livestock that were with him in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth. The waters subsided. 
verse:8:2 The deep's fountains and the sky's windows were also stopped, and the rain from the sky was restrained. 
verse:8:3 The waters receded from the earth continually. After the end of one hundred fifty days the waters decreased. 
verse:8:4 The ship rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on Ararat's mountains. 
verse:8:5 The waters receded continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.
verse:8:6 It happened at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made, 
verse:8:7 and he sent out a raven. It went back and forth, until the waters were dried up from the earth. 
verse:8:8 He sent out a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground, 
verse:8:9 but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned to him into the ship; for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth. He put out his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ship. 
verse:8:10 He stayed yet another seven days; and again he sent the dove out of the ship. 
verse:8:11 The dove came back to him at evening, and, behold, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off. So Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth. 
verse:8:12 He stayed yet another seven days, and sent out the dove; and she didn't return to him any more.
verse:8:13 It happened in the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of the ship, and looked. He saw that the surface of the ground was dried. 
verse:8:14 In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
portion:Genesis 8:15 - 9:7
verse:8:15 God spoke to Noah, saying, 
verse:8:16 "Go out of the ship, you, and your wife, and your sons, and your sons' wives with you. 
verse:8:17 Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth."
verse:8:18 Noah went out, with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives with him. 
verse:8:19 Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.
verse:8:20 Noah built an altar to HASHEM, and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 
verse:8:21 HASHEM smelled the pleasant aroma. HASHEM said in his heart, "I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I ever again strike everything living, as I have done. 
verse:8:22 While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."
verse:9:1 God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. 
verse:9:2 The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky. Everything that the ground teems with, and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand. 
verse:9:3 Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. As the green herb, I have given everything to you. 
verse:9:4 But flesh with its life, its blood, you shall not eat. 
verse:9:5 I will surely require your blood of your lives. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, I will require the life of man. 
verse:9:6 Whoever sheds man's blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man in his own image. 
verse:9:7 Be fruitful and multiply. Increase abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it."
portion:Genesis 9:8 - 9:17
verse:9:8 God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying, 
verse:9:9 "As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your offspring after you, 
verse:9:10 and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth. 
verse:9:11 I will establish my covenant with you: all flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood, neither will there ever again be a flood to destroy the earth." 
verse:9:12 God said, "This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 
verse:9:13 I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth. 
verse:9:14 It will happen, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud, 
verse:9:15 and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
verse:9:16 The rainbow will be in the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth." 
verse:9:17 God said to Noah, "This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."
portion:Genesis 9:18 - 10:32
verse:9:18 The sons of Noah who went out from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the father of Canaan. 
verse:9:19 These three were the sons of Noah, and from these, the whole earth was populated.
verse:9:20 Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard. 
verse:9:21 He drank of the wine and got drunk. He was uncovered within his tent. 
verse:9:22 Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside. 
verse:9:23 Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backwards, and they didn't see their father's nakedness. 
verse:9:24 Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to him. 
verse:9:25 He said, "Canaan is cursed. He will be servant of servants to his brothers."
verse:9:26 He said, "Blessed be HASHEM, the God of Shem. Let Canaan be his servant. 
verse:9:27 May God enlarge Japheth. Let him dwell in the tents of Shem. Let Canaan be his servant."
verse:9:28 Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood. 
verse:9:29 All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years, then he died.
verse:10:1 Now this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.

verse:10:7 The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan. 
verse:10:8 Cush became the father of Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth. 
verse:10:9 He was a mighty hunter before HASHEM. Therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before HASHEM." 
verse:10:10 The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
verse:10:11 Out of that land he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah, 
verse:10:12 and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city). 
verse:10:13 Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, 
verse:10:14 Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from), and Caphtorim.
verse:10:15 Canaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth,

verse:10:17 the Hivite, the Arkite, the Sinite, 
verse:10:18 the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad. 
verse:10:19 The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you go toward Gerar, to Gaza; as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, to Lasha. 
verse:10:20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their languages, in their lands, in their nations.
verse:10:21 To Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born. 
verse:10:22 The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. 
verse:10:23 The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.

verse:10:25 To Eber were born two sons. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. His brother's name was Joktan. 
verse:10:26 Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
verse:10:27 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
verse:10:28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
verse:10:29 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan. 
verse:10:30 Their dwelling was from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east. 
verse:10:31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their languages, in their lands, after their nations.
verse:10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations. Of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
portion:Genesis 11:1 - 11:32
verse:11:1 The whole earth was of one language and of one speech. 
verse:11:2 It happened, as they traveled east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there. 
verse:11:3 They said one to another, "Come, let's make bricks, and burn them thoroughly." They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar. 
verse:11:4 They said, "Come, let's build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let's make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth."
verse:11:5 HASHEM came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built. 
verse:11:6 HASHEM said, "Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do. 
verse:11:7 Come, let's go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech." 
verse:11:8 So HASHEM scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city. 
verse:11:9 Therefore its name was called Babel, because there HASHEM confused the language of all the earth. From there, HASHEM scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.
verse:11:10 This is the history of the generations of Shem. Shem was one hundred years old and became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood. 
verse:11:11 Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and became the father of sons and daughters.
verse:11:12 Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah. 
verse:11:13 Arpachshad lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Shelah, and became the father of sons and daughters.

verse:11:15 and Shelah lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Eber, and became the father of sons and daughters.
verse:11:16 Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg. 
verse:11:17 Eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father of Peleg, and became the father of sons and daughters.

verse:11:19 Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father of Reu, and became the father of sons and daughters.

verse:11:21 Reu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father of Serug, and became the father of sons and daughters.

verse:11:23 Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and became the father of sons and daughters.

verse:11:25 Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and became the father of sons and daughters.
verse:11:26 Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
verse:11:27 Now this is the history of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the father of Lot. 
verse:11:28 Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur-Kasdim. 
verse:11:29 Abram and Nahor took wives. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran who was also the father of Iscah. 
verse:11:30 Sarai was barren. She had no child. 
verse:11:31 Terah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife. They went from Ur-Kasdim, to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived there.

verse:11:32 The days of Terah were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran.
portion:Genesis 12:1 - 12:13
verse:12:1 Now HASHEM said to Abram, "Get out of your country, and from your relatives, and from your father's house, to the land that I will show you. 
verse:12:2 I will make of you a great nation. I will bless you and make your name great. You will be a blessing. 
verse:12:3 I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who curses you. All of the families of the earth will be blessed in you."
verse:12:4 So Abram went, as HASHEM had spoken to him. Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran. 
verse:12:5 Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother's son, all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls whom they had gotten in Haran, and they went to go into the land of Canaan. Into the land of Canaan they came. 
verse:12:6 Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. The Canaanite was then in the land.
verse:12:7 HASHEM appeared to Abram and said, "I will give this land to your seed."
He built an altar there to HASHEM, who appeared to him. 
verse:12:8 He left from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to HASHEM and called on the name of HASHEM. 
verse:12:9 Abram traveled, going on still toward the South.
verse:12:10 There was a famine in the land. Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe in the land. 
verse:12:11 It happened, when he had come near to enter Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, "See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at. 
verse:12:12 It will happen, when the Egyptians will see you, that they will say, 'This is his wife.' They will kill me, but they will save you alive. 
verse:12:13 Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you."
portion:Genesis 12:14 - 13:4
verse:12:14 It happened that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. 
verse:12:15 The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. 
verse:12:16 He dealt well with Abram for her sake. He had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels. 
verse:12:17 HASHEM plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife. 
verse:12:18 Pharaoh called Abram and said, "What is this that you have done to me? Why didn't you tell me that she was your wife? 
verse:12:19 Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore, see your wife, take her, and go your way."
verse:12:20 Pharaoh commanded men concerning him, and they brought him on the way with his wife and all that he had.
verse:13:1 Abram went up out of Egypt: he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South. 
verse:13:2 Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. 
verse:13:3 He went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, 
verse:13:4 to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. There Abram called on the name of HASHEM.
portion:Genesis 13:5 - 13:18
verse:13:5 Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. 
verse:13:6 The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together: for their substance was great, so that they could not live together. 
verse:13:7 There was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time. 
verse:13:8 Abram said to Lot, "Please, let there be no strife between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we are relatives. 
verse:13:9 Isn't the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left."
verse:13:10 Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before HASHEM destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of HASHEM, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar. 
verse:13:11 So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves the one from the other. 
verse:13:12 Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom. 
verse:13:13 Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against HASHEM.
verse:13:14 HASHEM said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, "Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, 
verse:13:15 for all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to your offspring forever. 
verse:13:16 I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then your seed may also be numbered. 
verse:13:17 Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its breadth; for I will give it to you."
verse:13:18 Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to HASHEM.
portion:Genesis 14:1 - 14:20
verse:14:1 It happened in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch, king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim, 
verse:14:2 that they made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha, king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah, and Shemeber, king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar). 
verse:14:3 All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea). 
verse:14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year, they rebelled. 
verse:14:5 In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came, and the kings who were with him, and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 
verse:14:6 and the Horites in their Mount Seir, to Elparan, which is by the wilderness. 
verse:14:7 They returned, and came to En Mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that lived in Hazazon Tamar. 
verse:14:8 The king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in array against them in the valley of Siddim; 
verse:14:9 against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five. 
verse:14:10 Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and those who remained fled to the hills. 
verse:14:11 They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way. 
verse:14:12 They took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
verse:14:13 One who had escaped came and told Abram, the Hebrew. Now he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were allies of Abram. 
verse:14:14 When Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he led out his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan. 
verse:14:15 He divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. 
verse:14:16 He brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative, Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
verse:14:17 The king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley). 
verse:14:18 Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High. 
verse:14:19 He blessed him, and said, "Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth: 
verse:14:20 and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand."
Abram gave him a tenth of all.
portion:Genesis 14:21 - 15:6
verse:14:21 The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people, and take the goods to yourself."
verse:14:22 Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have lifted up my hand to HASHEM, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth, 
verse:14:23 that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours, lest you should say, 'I have made Abram rich.' 
verse:14:24 I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion."
verse:15:1 After these things the word of HASHEM came to Abram in a vision, saying, "Don't be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward."
verse:15:2 Abram said, "My Lord, HASHEM, what will you give me, since I go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?" 
verse:15:3 Abram said, "Behold, to me you have given no seed: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir."
verse:15:4 Behold, the word of HASHEM came to him, saying, "This man will not be your heir, but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir." 
verse:15:5 HASHEM brought him outside, and said, "Look now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to count them." He said to Abram, "So shall your seed be." 
verse:15:6 He believed in HASHEM; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.
portion:Genesis 15:7 - 17:6
verse:15:7 He said to him, "I am HASHEM who brought you out of Ur-Kasdim, to give you this land to inherit it."
verse:15:8 He said, "My Lord, HASHEM GOD, how will I know that I will inherit it?"
verse:15:9 He said to him, "Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon." 
verse:15:10 He brought him all of these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he didn't divide the birds. 
verse:15:11 The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.
verse:15:12 When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and great darkness fell on him. 
verse:15:13 He said to Abram, "Know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four hundred years. 
verse:15:14 I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with great wealth, 
verse:15:15 but you will go to your fathers in peace. You will be buried in a good old age. 
verse:15:16 In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full." 
verse:15:17 It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch passed between these pieces. 
verse:15:18 In that day HASHEM made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates: 
verse:15:19 the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 
verse:15:20 the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, 
verse:15:21 the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."
verse:16:1 Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. 
verse:16:2 Sarai said to Abram, "See now, HASHEM has restrained me from bearing. Please go in to my handmaid. It may be that I will obtain children by her." Abram listened to the voice of Sarai. 
verse:16:3 Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife. 
verse:16:4 He went in to Hagar, and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. 
verse:16:5 Sarai said to Abram, "This wrong is your fault. I gave my handmaid into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. HASHEM judge between me and you."
verse:16:6 But Abram said to Sarai, "Behold, your maid is in your hand. Do to her whatever is good in your eyes." Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her face.
verse:16:7 The angel of HASHEM found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. 
verse:16:8 He said, "Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, where did you come from? Where are you going?"
She said, "I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai."
verse:16:9 The angel of HASHEM said to her, "Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hands." 
verse:16:10 The angel of HASHEM said to her, "I will greatly multiply your seed, that they will not be numbered for multitude." 
verse:16:11 The angel of HASHEM said to her, "Behold, you are with child, and will bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because HASHEM has heard your affliction. 
verse:16:12 He will be like a wild donkey among men. His hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him. He will live opposite all of his brothers."
verse:16:13 She called the name of HASHEM who spoke to her, "You are a God who sees," for she said, "Have I even stayed alive after seeing him?" 
verse:16:14 Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi. Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
verse:16:15 Hagar bore a son for Abram. Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. 
verse:16:16 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
verse:17:1 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, HASHEM appeared to Abram, and said to him, "I am God Almighty. Walk before me, and be blameless. 
verse:17:2 I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly."
verse:17:3 Abram fell on his face. God talked with him, saying, 
verse:17:4 "As for me, behold, my covenant is with you. You will be the father of a multitude of nations. 
verse:17:5 Neither will your name any more be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. 
verse:17:6 I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you. Kings will come out of you.
portion:Genesis 17:7 - 17:27
verse:17:7 I will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your seed after you. 
verse:17:8 I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land where you are traveling, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. I will be their God."
verse:17:9 God said to Abraham, "As for you, you will keep my covenant, you and your seed after you throughout their generations. 
verse:17:10 This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your seed after you. Every male among you shall be circumcised. 
verse:17:11 You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin. It will be a token of the covenant between me and you. 
verse:17:12 He who is eight days old will be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he who is born in the house, or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your seed. 
verse:17:13 He who is born in your house, and he who is bought with your money, must be circumcised. My covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 
verse:17:14 The uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people. He has broken my covenant."
verse:17:15 God said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but her name will be Sarah. 
verse:17:16 I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. Yes, I will bless her, and she will be a mother of nations. Kings of peoples will come from her."
verse:17:17 Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, "Will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old? Will Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?" 
verse:17:18 Abraham said to God, "Oh that Ishmael might live before you!"
verse:17:19 God said, "No, but Sarah, your wife, will bear you a son. You shall call his name Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him. 
verse:17:20 As for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He will become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. 
verse:17:21 But my covenant I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year."
verse:17:22 When he finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham. 
verse:17:23 Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money; every male among the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day, as God had said to him. 
verse:17:24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
verse:17:25 Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
verse:17:26 In the same day both Abraham and Ishmael, his son, were circumcised. 
verse:17:27 All the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
portion:Genesis 17:24 - 17:27
verse:17:24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
verse:17:25 Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
verse:17:26 In the same day both Abraham and Ishmael, his son, were circumcised. 
verse:17:27 All the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
portion:Genesis 18:1 - 18:14
verse:18:1 HASHEM appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day. 
verse:18:2 He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men stood opposite him. When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth, 
verse:18:3 and said, "My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, please don't go away from your servant. 
verse:18:4 Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree. 
verse:18:5 I will get a morsel of bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you may go your way, now that you have come to your servant."
They said, "Very well, do as you have said."
verse:18:6 Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, "Quickly prepare three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes." 
verse:18:7 Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant. He hurried to dress it. 
verse:18:8 He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree, and they ate.
verse:18:9 They asked him, "Where is Sarah, your wife?"
He said, "See, in the tent."
verse:18:10 He said, "I will certainly return to you when the season comes round. Behold, Sarah your wife will have a son."
Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him. 
verse:18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing. 
verse:18:12 Sarah laughed within herself, saying, "After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
verse:18:13 HASHEM said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Will I really bear a child, yet I am old?' 
verse:18:14 Is anything too hard for HASHEM? At the set time I will return to you, when the season comes round, and Sarah will have a son."
portion:Genesis 18:15 - 18:33
verse:18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, "I didn't laugh," for she was afraid.
He said, "No, but you did laugh."
verse:18:16 The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way. 
verse:18:17 HASHEM said, "Will I hide from Abraham what I do, 
verse:18:18 since Abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him? 
verse:18:19 For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of HASHEM, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that HASHEM may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him." 
verse:18:20 HASHEM said, "Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous, 
verse:18:21 I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me. If not, I will know."
verse:18:22 The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before HASHEM. 
verse:18:23 Abraham drew near, and said, "Will you consume the righteous with the wicked? 
verse:18:24 What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it? 
verse:18:25 Be it far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Shouldn't the Judge of all the earth do right?"
verse:18:26 HASHEM said, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake." 
verse:18:27 Abraham answered, "See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to my Lord, who am but dust and ashes. 
verse:18:28 What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?"
He said, "I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there."
verse:18:29 He spoke to him yet again, and said, "What if there are forty found there?"
He said, "I will not do it for the forty's sake."
verse:18:30 He said, "Oh don't let my Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty found there?"
He said, "I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
verse:18:31 He said, "See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to my Lord. What if there are twenty found there?"
He said, "I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake."
verse:18:32 He said, "Oh don't let my Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more. What if ten are found there?"
He said, "I will not destroy it for the ten's sake."
verse:18:33 HASHEM went his way, as soon as he had finished communing with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.
portion:Genesis 19:1 - 19:20
verse:19:1 The two angels came to Sodom at evening. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth, 
verse:19:2 and he said, "See now, my lords, please turn aside into your servant's house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your way."
They said, "No, but we will stay in the street all night."
verse:19:3 He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. 
verse:19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter. 
verse:19:5 They called to Lot, and said to him, "Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them."
verse:19:6 Lot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him. 
verse:19:7 He said, "Please, my brothers, don't act so wickedly. 
verse:19:8 See now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don't do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof."
verse:19:9 They said, "Stand back!" Then they said, "This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now will we deal worse with you, than with them!" They pressed hard on the man Lot, and drew near to break the door. 
verse:19:10 But the men reached out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door. 
verse:19:11 They struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
verse:19:12 The men said to Lot, "Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever you have in the city, bring them out of the place: 
verse:19:13 for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown great before HASHEM that HASHEM has sent us to destroy it."
verse:19:14 Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, "Get up! Get out of this place, for HASHEM will destroy the city."
But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking. 
verse:19:15 When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, "Get up! Take your wife, and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city." 
verse:19:16 But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife's hand, and his two daughters' hands, HASHEM being merciful to him; and they took him out, and set him outside of the city. 
verse:19:17 It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, "Escape for your life! Don't look behind you, and don't stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!"
verse:19:18 Lot said to them, "Oh, not so, my lord. 
verse:19:19 See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can't escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die. 
verse:19:20 See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn't it a little one?), and my soul will live."
portion:Genesis 19:21 - 21:4
verse:19:21 He said to him, "Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. 
verse:19:22 Hurry, escape there, for I can't do anything until you get there." Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
verse:19:23 The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar. 
verse:19:24 Then HASHEM rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from HASHEM out of the sky. 
verse:19:25 He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground. 
verse:19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
verse:19:27 Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before HASHEM. 
verse:19:28 He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and looked, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.
verse:19:29 It happened, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.
verse:19:30 Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters. 
verse:19:31 The firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth. 
verse:19:32 Come, let's make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father's seed." 
verse:19:33 They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He didn't know when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
verse:19:34 It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, "Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine again, tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father's seed." 
verse:19:35 They made their father drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn't know when she lay down, nor when she got up. 
verse:19:36 Thus both of Lot's daughters were with child by their father. 
verse:19:37 The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day.

verse:20:1 Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He lived as a foreigner in Gerar. 
verse:20:2 Abraham said about Sarah his wife, "She is my sister." Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. 
verse:20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, "Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken. For she is a man's wife."
verse:20:4 Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, "My Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation? 
verse:20:5 Didn't he tell me, 'She is my sister?' She, even she herself, said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have I done this."
verse:20:6 God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn't allow you to touch her. 
verse:20:7 Now therefore, restore the man's wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you don't restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours."
verse:20:8 Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. The men were very scared. 
verse:20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, "What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!" 
verse:20:10 Abimelech said to Abraham, "What did you see, that you have done this thing?"
verse:20:11 Abraham said, "Because I thought, 'Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife's sake.' 
verse:20:12 Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. 
verse:20:13 It happened, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, 'This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, "He is my brother."'"
verse:20:14 Abimelech took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him. 
verse:20:15 Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you." 
verse:20:16 To Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated."
verse:20:17 Abraham prayed to God. God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his female servants, and they bore children. 
verse:20:18 For HASHEM had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
verse:21:1 HASHEM visited Sarah as he had said, and HASHEM did to Sarah as he had spoken. 
verse:21:2 Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. 
verse:21:3 Abraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac. 
verse:21:4 Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
portion:Genesis 21:5 - 21:21
verse:21:5 Abraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac, was born to him. 
verse:21:6 Sarah said, "God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me." 
verse:21:7 She said, "Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in his old age."
verse:21:8 The child grew, and was weaned. Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. 
verse:21:9 Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking. 
verse:21:10 Therefore she said to Abraham, "Cast out this handmaid and her son! For the son of this handmaid will not be heir with my son, Isaac."
verse:21:11 The thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son. 
verse:21:12 God said to Abraham, "Don't let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your handmaid. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For from Isaac will your seed be called. 
verse:21:13 I will also make a nation of the son of the handmaid, because he is your seed." 
verse:21:14 Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child, and sent her away. She departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. 
verse:21:15 The water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. 
verse:21:16 She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, "Don't let me see the death of the child." She sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept. 
verse:21:17 God heard the voice of the boy.
The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, "What ails you, Hagar? Don't be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. 
verse:21:18 Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him in your hand. For I will make him a great nation."
verse:21:19 God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went, filled the bottle with water, and gave the boy drink. 
verse:21:20 God was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer. 
verse:21:21 He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.
portion:Genesis 21:22 - 21:34
verse:21:22 It happened at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, "God is with you in all that you do. 
verse:21:23 Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner."
verse:21:24 Abraham said, "I will swear." 
verse:21:25 Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. 
verse:21:26 Abimelech said, "I don't know who has done this thing. You didn't tell me, neither did I hear of it, until today."
verse:21:27 Abraham took sheep and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant. 
verse:21:28 Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 
verse:21:29 Abimelech said to Abraham, "What do these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves mean?"
verse:21:30 He said, "You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well." 
verse:21:31 Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because they both swore there. 
verse:21:32 So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. 
verse:21:33 Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and called there on the name of HASHEM, the Everlasting God. 
verse:21:34 Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days.
portion:Genesis 22:1 - 22:24
verse:22:1 It happened after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him, "Abraham!"
He said, "Here I am."
verse:22:2 He said, "Now take your son, your only son, whom you love, even Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah. Offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of."
verse:22:3 Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him. 
verse:22:4 On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off. 
verse:22:5 Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go yonder. We will worship, and come back to you." 
verse:22:6 Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. He took in his hand the fire and the knife. They both went together. 
verse:22:7 Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, "My father?"
He said, "Here I am, my son."
He said, "Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
verse:22:8 Abraham said, "God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son." So they both went together. 
verse:22:9 They came to the place which God had told him of. Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood. 
verse:22:10 Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to kill his son.
verse:22:11 The angel of HASHEM called to him out of the sky, and said, "Abraham, Abraham!"
He said, "Here I am."
verse:22:12 He said, "Don't lay your hand on the boy, neither do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me."
verse:22:13 Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son. 
verse:22:14 Abraham called the name of that place HASHEM Will Provide. As it is said to this day, "On HASHEM's mountain, it will be provided."
verse:22:15 The angel of HASHEM called to Abraham a second time out of the sky, 
verse:22:16 and said, "I have sworn by myself, says HASHEM, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son, 
verse:22:17 that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore. Your seed will possess the gate of his enemies. 
verse:22:18 In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice."
verse:22:19 So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. Abraham lived at Beersheba.
verse:22:20 It happened after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, "Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to your brother Nahor: 
verse:22:21 Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, 
verse:22:22 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."

verse:23:1 Sarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years. This was the length of Sarah's life. 
verse:23:2 Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. 
verse:23:3 Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the children of Heth, saying, 
verse:23:4 "I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
verse:23:5 The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, 
verse:23:6 "Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead."
verse:23:7 Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth. 
verse:23:8 He talked with them, saying, "If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 
verse:23:9 that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a burying-place."
verse:23:10 Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth. Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying, 
verse:23:11 "No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead."
verse:23:12 Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land. 
verse:23:13 He spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, "But if you will, please hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there."
verse:23:14 Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, 
verse:23:15 "My lord, listen to me. What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and you? Therefore bury your dead."
verse:23:16 Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the current merchants' standard.
portion:Genesis 23:17 - 24:9
verse:23:17 So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all of its borders, were deeded 
verse:23:18 to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city. 
verse:23:19 After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan. 
verse:23:20 The field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the children of Heth.
verse:24:1 Abraham was old, and well stricken in age. HASHEM had blessed Abraham in all things. 
verse:24:2 Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, "Please put your hand under my thigh. 
verse:24:3 I will make you swear by HASHEM, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live. 
verse:24:4 But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac."
verse:24:5 The servant said to him, "What if the woman isn't willing to follow me to this land? Must I bring your son again to the land you came from?"
verse:24:6 Abraham said to him, "Beware that you don't bring my son there again. 
verse:24:7 HASHEM, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, 'I will give this land to your seed.' He will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there. 
verse:24:8 If the woman isn't willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this my oath. Only you shall not bring my son there again."

verse:24:11 He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water. 
verse:24:12 He said, "HASHEM, the God of my master Abraham, please give me success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham. 
verse:24:13 Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water. 
verse:24:14 Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, 'Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,' and she will say, 'Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,'--let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master."
verse:24:15 It happened, before he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder. 
verse:24:16 The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin, neither had any man known her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up. 
verse:24:17 The servant ran to meet her, and said, "Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher."
verse:24:18 She said, "Drink, my lord." She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him drink. 
verse:24:19 When she had done giving him drink, she said, "I will also draw for your camels, until they have done drinking." 
verse:24:20 She hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.
verse:24:21 The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether HASHEM had made his journey prosperous or not. 
verse:24:22 It happened, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold, 
verse:24:23 and said, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father's house for us to lodge in?"

verse:24:29 Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man, to the spring. 
verse:24:30 It happened, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, "This is what the man said to me," that he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring. 
verse:24:31 He said, "Come in, you blessed of HASHEM. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels."
verse:24:32 The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. 
verse:24:33 Food was set before him to eat, but he said, "I will not eat until I have told my message."
He said, "Speak on."
verse:24:34 He said, "I am Abraham's servant. 
verse:24:35 HASHEM has blessed my master greatly. He has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys. 
verse:24:36 Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given all that he has to him. 
verse:24:37 My master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, 
verse:24:38 but you shall go to my father's house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.' 
verse:24:39 I asked my master, 'What if the woman will not follow me?' 
verse:24:40 He said to me, 'HASHEM, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son of my relatives, and of my father's house. 
verse:24:41 Then will you be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don't give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.' 
verse:24:42 I came this day to the spring, and said, 'HASHEM, the God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go--
verse:24:43 behold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes out to draw, to whom I will say, "Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink," 
verse:24:44 and she will tell me, "Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,"--let her be the woman whom HASHEM has appointed for my master's son.' 
verse:24:45 Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, 'Please let me drink.' 
verse:24:46 She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, 'Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.' So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink. 
verse:24:47 I asked her, and said, 'Whose daughter are you?' She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.' I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands. 
verse:24:48 I bowed my head, and worshiped HASHEM, and blessed HASHEM, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son. 
verse:24:49 Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."
verse:24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered, "The thing proceeds from HASHEM. We can't speak to you bad or good. 
verse:24:51 Behold, Rebekah is before you. Take her, and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as HASHEM has spoken."

verse:25:27 The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents. 
verse:25:28 Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob. 
verse:25:29 Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished. 
verse:25:30 Esau said to Jacob, "Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am famished." Therefore his name was called Edom.
verse:25:31 Jacob said, "First, sell me your birthright."
verse:25:32 Esau said, "Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?"
verse:25:33 Jacob said, "Swear to me first."
He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob. 
verse:25:34 Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.
verse:26:1 There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar. 
verse:26:2 HASHEM appeared to him, and said, "Don't go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about. 
verse:26:3 Live in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father. 
verse:26:4 I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and will give to your seed all these lands. In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed, 
verse:26:5 because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
portion:Genesis 26:6 - 26:12
verse:26:6 Isaac lived in Gerar. 
verse:26:7 The men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, "She is my sister," for he was afraid to say, "My wife," lest, he thought, "the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at." 
verse:26:8 It happened, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife. 
verse:26:9 Abimelech called Isaac, and said, "Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, 'She is my sister?'"
Isaac said to him, "Because I said, 'Lest I die because of her.'"
verse:26:10 Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!"
verse:26:11 Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, "He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death."
verse:26:12 Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. HASHEM blessed him.
portion:Genesis 26:13 - 26:22
verse:26:13 The man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great. 
verse:26:14 He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him. 
verse:26:15 Now all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth. 
verse:26:16 Abimelech said to Isaac, "Go from us, for you are much mightier than we."
verse:26:17 Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.
verse:26:18 Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called their names after the names by which his father had called them. 
verse:26:19 Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. 
verse:26:20 The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, "The water is ours." He called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him. 
verse:26:21 They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. He called its name Sitnah. 
verse:26:22 He left that place, and dug another well. They didn't argue over that one. He called it Rehoboth. He said, "For now HASHEM has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land."
portion:Genesis 26:23 - 26:29
verse:26:23 He went up from there to Beersheba. 
verse:26:24 HASHEM appeared to him the same night, and said, "I am the God of Abraham your father. Don't be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your seed for my servant Abraham's sake."
verse:26:25 He built an altar there, and called on the name of HASHEM, and pitched his tent there. There Isaac's servants dug a well.
verse:26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army. 
verse:26:27 Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
verse:26:28 They said, "We saw plainly that HASHEM was with you. We said, 'Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you, 
verse:26:29 that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.' You are now the blessed of HASHEM."
portion:Genesis 26:30 - 27:27
verse:26:30 He made them a feast, and they ate and drank. 
verse:26:31 They rose up some time in the morning, and swore one to another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 
verse:26:32 It happened the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, "We have found water." 
verse:26:33 He called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.
verse:26:34 When Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite. 
verse:26:35 They grieved Isaac's and Rebekah's spirits.
verse:27:1 It happened, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, "My son?"
He said to him, "Here I am."
verse:27:2 He said, "See now, I am old. I don't know the day of my death. 
verse:27:3 Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison. 
verse:27:4 Make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die."
verse:27:5 Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. 
verse:27:6 Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, "Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying, 
verse:27:7 'Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before HASHEM before my death.' 
verse:27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you. 
verse:27:9 Go now to the flock, and get me from there two good young goats. I will make them savory food for your father, such as he loves. 
verse:27:10 You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death."
verse:27:11 Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. 
verse:27:12 What if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing."
verse:27:13 His mother said to him, "Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them for me."
verse:27:14 He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savory food, such as his father loved. 
verse:27:15 Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son. 
verse:27:16 She put the skins of the young goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck. 
verse:27:17 She gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
verse:27:18 He came to his father, and said, "My father?"
He said, "Here I am. Who are you, my son?"
verse:27:19 Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn. I have done what you asked me to do. Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me."
verse:27:20 Isaac said to his son, "How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?"
He said, "Because HASHEM your God gave me success."
verse:27:21 Isaac said to Jacob, "Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not."
verse:27:22 Jacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau." 
verse:27:23 He didn't recognize him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother, Esau's hands. So he blessed him. 
verse:27:24 He said, "Are you really my son Esau?"
He said, "I am."
verse:27:25 He said, "Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless you."
He brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought him wine, and he drank. 
verse:27:26 His father Isaac said to him, "Come near now, and kiss me, my son." 
verse:27:27 He came near, and kissed him. He smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him, and said, "Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which HASHEM has blessed.
portion:Genesis 27:28 - 28:4
verse:27:28 God give you of the dew of the sky, of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and new wine. 
verse:27:29 Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers. Let your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you. Blessed be everyone who blesses you."
verse:27:30 It happened, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
verse:27:31 He also made savory food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father, "Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that your soul may bless me."
verse:27:32 Isaac his father said to him, "Who are you?"
He said, "I am your son, your firstborn, Esau."
verse:27:33 Isaac trembled violently, and said, "Who, then, is he who has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? Yes, he will be blessed."
verse:27:34 When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said to his father, "Bless me, even me also, my father."
verse:27:35 He said, "Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing."
verse:27:36 He said, "Isn't he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing." He said, "Haven't you reserved a blessing for me?"
verse:27:37 Isaac answered Esau, "Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants. With grain and new wine have I sustained him. What then will I do for you, my son?"
verse:27:38 Esau said to his father, "Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my father." Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
verse:27:39 Isaac his father answered him, "Behold, of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling, and of the dew of the sky from above. 
verse:27:40 By your sword will you live, and you will serve your brother. It will happen, when you will break loose, that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck."
verse:27:41 Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau said in his heart, "The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob."
verse:27:42 The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, "Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you. 
verse:27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my brother, in Haran. 
verse:27:44 Stay with him a few days, until your brother's fury turns away; 
verse:27:45 until your brother's anger turn away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?"
verse:27:46 Rebekah said to Isaac, "I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?"
verse:28:1 Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, "You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. 
verse:28:2 Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father. Take a wife from there from the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother. 
verse:28:3 May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples, 
verse:28:4 and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your seed with you, that you may inherit the land where you travel, which God gave to Abraham."
portion:Genesis 28:5 - 28:9
verse:28:5 Isaac sent Jacob away. He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, Rebekah's brother, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
verse:28:6 Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram, to take him a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying, "You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan," 
verse:28:7 and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram. 
verse:28:8 Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn't please Isaac, his father. 
verse:28:9 Esau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.
portion:Genesis 28:7 - 28:9
verse:28:7 and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram.

verse:28:9 Esau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.
portion:Genesis 28:10 - 28:22
verse:28:10 Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. 
verse:28:11 He came to a certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep. 
verse:28:12 He dreamed. Behold, a stairway set upon the earth, and its top reached to heaven. Behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it. 
verse:28:13 Behold, HASHEM stood above it, and said, "I am HASHEM, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac. The land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed. 
verse:28:14 Your seed will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. In you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed. 
verse:28:15 Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken of to you."
verse:28:16 Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, "Surely HASHEM is in this place, and I didn't know it." 
verse:28:17 He was afraid, and said, "How dreadful is this place! This is none other than God's house, and this is the gate of heaven."
verse:28:18 Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on its top. 
verse:28:19 He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first. 
verse:28:20 Jacob vowed a vow, saying, "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on, 
verse:28:21 so that I come again to my father's house in peace, and HASHEM will be my God, 
verse:28:22 then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be God's house. Of all that you will give me I will surely give the tenth to you."
portion:Genesis 29:1 - 29:17
verse:29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east. 
verse:29:2 He looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, behold, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well's mouth was large. 
verse:29:3 There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well's mouth in its place. 
verse:29:4 Jacob said to them, "My relatives, where are you from?"
They said, "We are from Haran."
verse:29:5 He said to them, "Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?"
They said, "We know him."
verse:29:6 He said to them, "Is it well with him?"
They said, "It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep."
verse:29:7 He said, "Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them."
verse:29:8 They said, "We can't, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth. Then we water the sheep."
verse:29:9 While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she kept them. 
verse:29:10 It happened, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. 
verse:29:11 Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. 
verse:29:12 Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son. She ran and told her father.
verse:29:13 It happened, when Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister's son, that he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things. 
verse:29:14 Laban said to him, "Surely you are my bone and my flesh." He lived with him for a month. 
verse:29:15 Laban said to Jacob, "Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?"
verse:29:16 Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 
verse:29:17 Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive.
portion:Genesis 29:18 - 30:13
verse:29:18 Jacob loved Rachel. He said, "I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter."
verse:29:19 Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me."
verse:29:20 Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.
verse:29:21 Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her."
verse:29:22 Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. 
verse:29:23 It happened in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. He went in to her. 
verse:29:24 Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid to his daughter Leah for a handmaid. 
verse:29:25 It happened in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. He said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Didn't I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?"
verse:29:26 Laban said, "It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn. 
verse:29:27 Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years."
verse:29:28 Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife. 
verse:29:29 Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her handmaid. 
verse:29:30 He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
verse:29:31 HASHEM saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren. 
verse:29:32 Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said, "Because HASHEM has looked at my affliction. For now my husband will love me." 
verse:29:33 She conceived again, and bore a son, and said, "Because HASHEM has heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also." She named him Simeon. 
verse:29:34 She conceived again, and bore a son. Said, "Now this time will my husband be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons." Therefore was his name called Levi. 
verse:29:35 She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, "This time will I praise HASHEM." Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.
verse:30:1 When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister. She said to Jacob, "Give me children, or else I will die."
verse:30:2 Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, "Am I in God's place, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"
verse:30:3 She said, "Behold, my maid Bilhah. Go in to her, that she may bear on my knees, and I also may obtain children by her." 
verse:30:4 She gave him Bilhah her handmaid as wife, and Jacob went in to her. 
verse:30:5 Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son. 
verse:30:6 Rachel said, "God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son." Therefore called she his name Dan. 
verse:30:7 Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son. 
verse:30:8 Rachel said, "With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed." She named him Naphtali.
verse:30:9 When Leah saw that she had finished bearing, she took Zilpah, her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob as a wife. 
verse:30:10 Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, bore Jacob a son. 
verse:30:11 Leah said, "How fortunate!" She named him Gad. 
verse:30:12 Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, bore Jacob a second son. 
verse:30:13 Leah said, "Happy am I, for the daughters will call me happy." She named him Asher.
portion:Genesis 30:14 - 30:27
verse:30:14 Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."
verse:30:15 She said to her, "Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes, also?"
Rachel said, "Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son's mandrakes."
verse:30:16 Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, "You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son's mandrakes."
He lay with her that night. 
verse:30:17 God listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son. 
verse:30:18 Leah said, "God has given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband." She named him Issachar. 
verse:30:19 Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob. 
verse:30:20 Leah said, "God has endowed me with a good dowry. Now my husband will live with me, because I have borne him six sons." She named him Zebulun. 
verse:30:21 Afterwards, she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.
verse:30:22 God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb. 
verse:30:23 She conceived, bore a son, and said, "God has taken away my reproach." 
verse:30:24 She named him Joseph, saying, "May HASHEM add another son to me."
verse:30:25 It happened, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country. 
verse:30:26 Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you."
verse:30:27 Laban said to him, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, stay here, for I have divined that HASHEM has blessed me for your sake." 
portion:Genesis 30:28 - 31:16
verse:30:28 He said, "Appoint me your wages, and I will give it."
verse:30:29 He said to him, "You know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with me. 
verse:30:30 For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude. HASHEM has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide for my own house also?"
verse:30:31 He said, "What shall I give you?"
Jacob said, "You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it. 
verse:30:32 I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. This will be my hire. 
verse:30:33 So my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my hire that is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be counted stolen."
verse:30:34 Laban said, "Behold, let it be according to your word."
verse:30:35 That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. 
verse:30:36 He set three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
verse:30:37 Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, plane tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. 
verse:30:38 He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink. 
verse:30:39 The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks produced streaked, speckled, and spotted. 
verse:30:40 Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and didn't put them into Laban's flock. 
verse:30:41 It happened, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods; 
verse:30:42 but when the flock were feeble, he didn't put them in. So the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's. 
verse:30:43 The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
verse:31:1 He heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, "Jacob has taken away all that was our father's. From that which was our father's, has he gotten all this wealth." 
verse:31:2 Jacob saw the expression on Laban's face, and, behold, it was not toward him as before. 
verse:31:3 HASHEM said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers, and to your relatives, and I will be with you."
verse:31:4 Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock, 
verse:31:5 and said to them, "I see the expression on your father's face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me. 
verse:31:6 You know that I have served your father with all of my strength. 
verse:31:7 Your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God didn't allow him to hurt me. 
verse:31:8 If he said this, 'The speckled will be your wages,' then all the flock bore speckled. If he said this, 'The streaked will be your wages,' then all the flock bore streaked. 
verse:31:9 Thus God has taken away your father's livestock, and given them to me. 
verse:31:10 It happened during mating season that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled. 
verse:31:11 The angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am.' 
verse:31:12 He said, 'Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you. 
verse:31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.'"
verse:31:14 Rachel and Leah answered him, "Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house? 
verse:31:15 Aren't we accounted by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also quite devoured our money. 
verse:31:16 For all the riches which God has taken away from our father, that is ours and our children's. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do."
portion:Genesis 31:17 - 31:42
verse:31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels, 
verse:31:18 and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan. 
verse:31:19 Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's.
verse:31:20 Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn't tell him that he was running away. 
verse:31:21 So he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.
verse:31:22 Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled. 
verse:31:23 He took his relatives with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey. He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead. 
verse:31:24 God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night, and said to him, "Take heed to yourself that you don't speak to Jacob either good or bad."
verse:31:25 Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead. 
verse:31:26 Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword? 
verse:31:27 Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn't tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp; 
verse:31:28 and didn't allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly. 
verse:31:29 It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Take heed to yourself that you don't speak to Jacob either good or bad.' 
verse:31:30 Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father's house, but why have you stolen my gods?"
verse:31:31 Jacob answered Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I said, 'Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.' 
verse:31:32 Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it." For Jacob didn't know that Rachel had stolen them.
verse:31:33 Laban went into Jacob's tent, into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he didn't find them. He went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. 
verse:31:34 Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel's saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt about all the tent, but didn't find them. 
verse:31:35 She said to her father, "Don't let my lord be angry that I can't rise up before you; for I'm having my period." He searched, but didn't find the teraphim.
verse:31:36 Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, "What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me? 
verse:31:37 Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.
verse:31:38 "These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven't eaten the rams of your flocks. 
verse:31:39 That which was torn of animals, I didn't bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. 
verse:31:40 This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes. 
verse:31:41 These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. 
verse:31:42 Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night."
portion:Genesis 31:43 - 32:3
verse:31:43 Laban answered Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne? 
verse:31:44 Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be for a witness between me and you."
verse:31:45 Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. 
verse:31:46 Jacob said to his relatives, "Gather stones." They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap. 
verse:31:47 Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. 
verse:31:48 Laban said, "This heap is witness between me and you this day." Therefore it was named Galeed 
verse:31:49 and Mizpah, for he said, "HASHEM watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another. 
verse:31:50 If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you." 
verse:31:51 Laban said to Jacob, "See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you. 
verse:31:52 May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm. 
verse:31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac. 
verse:31:54 Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain. 
verse:32:1 Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban departed and returned to his place. 
verse:32:2 Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 
verse:32:3 When he saw them, Jacob said, "This is God's army." He called the name of that place Mahanaim.
portion:Genesis 32:1 - 32:3
verse:32:1 Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban departed and returned to his place. 
verse:32:2 Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 
verse:32:3 When he saw them, Jacob said, "This is God's army." He called the name of that place Mahanaim.
portion:Genesis 32:4 - 32:13
verse:32:4 Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom. 
verse:32:5 He commanded them, saying, "This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: 'This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now. 
verse:32:6 I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.'" 
verse:32:7 The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau. Not only that, but he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him." 
verse:32:8 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies; 
verse:32:9 and he said, "If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape." 
verse:32:10 Jacob said, "God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, HASHEM, who said to me, 'Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,' 
verse:32:11 I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies. 
verse:32:12 Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers with the children. 
verse:32:13 You said, 'I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which can't be numbered because there are so many.'"
portion:Genesis 32:14 - 32:30
verse:32:14 He lodged there that night, and took from that which he had with him, a present for Esau, his brother: 
verse:32:15 two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 
verse:32:16 thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals. 
verse:32:17 He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd." 
verse:32:18 He commanded the foremost, saying, "When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, 'Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?' 
verse:32:19 Then you shall say, 'They are your servant, Jacob's. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.'" 
verse:32:20 He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, "This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him. 
verse:32:21 You shall say, 'Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.'" For, he said, "I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me."
verse:32:22 So the present passed over before him, and he himself lodged that night in the camp.
verse:32:23 He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok. 
verse:32:24 He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had. 
verse:32:25 Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day. 
verse:32:26 When he saw that he didn't prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled. 
verse:32:27 The man said, "Let me go, for the day breaks."
Jacob said, "I won't let you go, unless you bless me."
verse:32:28 He said to him, "What is your name?"
He said, "Jacob." 
verse:32:29 He said, "Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed."
verse:32:30 Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name."
He said, "Why is it that you ask what my name is?" He blessed him there.
portion:Genesis 32:31 - 33:5
verse:32:31 Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, he said, "I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved." 
verse:32:32 The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh. 
verse:32:33 Therefore the children of Israel don't eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.
verse:33:1 Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two handmaids. 
verse:33:2 He put the handmaids and their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear. 
verse:33:3 He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
verse:33:4 Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept. 
verse:33:5 He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, "Who are these with you?"
He said, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant."
portion:Genesis 33:6 - 33:20
verse:33:6 Then the handmaids came near with their children, and they bowed themselves. 
verse:33:7 Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
verse:33:8 Esau said, "What do you mean by all this company which I met?"
Jacob said, "To find favor in the sight of my lord."
verse:33:9 Esau said, "I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours."
verse:33:10 Jacob said, "Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me. 
verse:33:11 Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough." He urged him, and he took it.
verse:33:12 Esau said, "Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you."
verse:33:13 Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die. 
verse:33:14 Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir."
verse:33:15 Esau said, "Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me."
He said, "Why? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord."
verse:33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. 
verse:33:17 Jacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
verse:33:18 Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city. 
verse:33:19 He bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for one hundred pieces of money. 
verse:33:20 He erected an altar there, and called it El Elohe Israel.
portion:Genesis 34:1 - 35:11
verse:34:1 Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. 
verse:34:2 Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her, and humbled her. 
verse:34:3 His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady. 
verse:34:4 Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, "Get me this young lady as a wife."
verse:34:5 Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field. Jacob held his peace until they came. 
verse:34:6 Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him. 
verse:34:7 The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. The men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; a which thing ought not to be done. 
verse:34:8 Hamor talked with them, saying, "The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife. 
verse:34:9 Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves. 
verse:34:10 You shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you. Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it."
verse:34:11 Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, "Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you will tell me I will give. 
verse:34:12 Ask me a great amount for a dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but give me the young lady as a wife."
verse:34:13 The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit, and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister, 
verse:34:14 and said to them, "We can't do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us. 
verse:34:15 Only on this condition will we consent to you. If you will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised; 
verse:34:16 then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. 
verse:34:17 But if you will not listen to us, to be circumcised, then we will take our sister, and we will be gone."
verse:34:18 Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son. 
verse:34:19 The young man didn't wait to do this thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter, and he was honored above all the house of his father. 
verse:34:20 Hamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying, 
verse:34:21 "These men are peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade in it. For behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. 
verse:34:22 Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised. 
verse:34:23 Won't their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let us give our consent to them, and they will dwell with us."
verse:34:24 All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city. 
verse:34:25 It happened on the third day, when they were sore, that two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city, and killed all the males. 
verse:34:26 They killed Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went away. 
verse:34:27 Jacob's sons came on the dead, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister. 
verse:34:28 They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the field, 
verse:34:29 and all their wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their wives, and took as plunder everything that was in the house. 
verse:34:30 Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number. They will gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house."
verse:34:31 They said, "Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute?"
verse:35:1 God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. Make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother."
verse:35:2 Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, "Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, change your garments. 
verse:35:3 Let us arise, and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went."
verse:35:4 They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. 
verse:35:5 They traveled, and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them, and they didn't pursue the sons of Jacob. 
verse:35:6 So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him. 
verse:35:7 He built an altar there, and called the place El Beth El; because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother. 
verse:35:8 Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and its name was called Allon Bacuth.
verse:35:9 God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan Aram, and blessed him. 
verse:35:10 God said to him, "Your name is Jacob. Your name shall not be Jacob any more, but your name will be Israel." He named him Israel. 
verse:35:11 God said to him, "I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations will be from you, and kings will come out of your body.
portion:Genesis 35:12 - 36:19
verse:35:12 The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, and to your seed after you will I give the land."
verse:35:13 God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him. 
verse:35:14 Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it. 
verse:35:15 Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him "Bethel."
verse:35:16 They traveled from Bethel. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed. She had hard labor. 
verse:35:17 When she was in hard labor, the midwife said to her, "Don't be afraid, for now you will have another son."
verse:35:18 It happened, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she named him Benoni, but his father named him Benjamin. 
verse:35:19 Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem). 
verse:35:20 Jacob set up a pillar on her grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave to this day. 
verse:35:21 Israel traveled, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder. 
verse:35:22 It happened, while Israel lived in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel heard of it.
Now the sons of Jacob were twelve. 
verse:35:23 The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. 
verse:35:24 The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 
verse:35:25 The sons of Bilhah (Rachel's handmaid): Dan and Naphtali. 
verse:35:26 The sons of Zilpah (Leah's handmaid): Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram. 
verse:35:27 Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, to Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac lived as foreigners.
verse:35:28 The days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years. 
verse:35:29 Isaac gave up the spirit, and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. Esau and Jacob, his sons, buried him.
verse:36:1 Now this is the history of the generations of Esau (that is, Edom). 
verse:36:2 Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon, the Hittite; and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, the Hivite; 
verse:36:3 and Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth. 
verse:36:4 Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz. Basemath bore Reuel. 
verse:36:5 Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan. 
verse:36:6 Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his household, with his livestock, all his animals, and all his possessions, which he had gathered in the land of Canaan, and went into a land away from his brother Jacob. 
verse:36:7 For their substance was too great for them to dwell together, and the land of their travels couldn't bear them because of their livestock. 
verse:36:8 Esau lived in the hill country of Seir. Esau is Edom.
verse:36:9 This is the history of the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir: 
verse:36:10 these are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz, the son of Adah, the wife of Esau; and Reuel, the son of Basemath, the wife of Esau. 
verse:36:11 The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.

verse:37:1 Jacob lived in the land of his father's travels, in the land of Canaan. 
verse:37:2 This is the history of the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. Joseph brought an evil report of them to their father. 
verse:37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a coat of many colors. 
verse:37:4 His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, and they hated him, and couldn't speak peaceably to him.
verse:37:5 Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him all the more. 
verse:37:6 He said to them, "Please hear this dream which I have dreamed: 
verse:37:7 for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves came around, and bowed down to my sheaf."
verse:37:8 His brothers said to him, "Will you indeed reign over us? Or will you indeed have dominion over us?" They hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words. 
verse:37:9 He dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, "Behold, I have dreamed yet another dream: and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me." 
verse:37:10 He told it to his father and to his brothers. His father rebuked him, and said to him, "What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to you to the earth?" 
verse:37:11 His brothers envied him, but his father kept this saying in mind.
portion:Genesis 37:12 - 37:22
verse:37:12 His brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. 
verse:37:13 Israel said to Joseph, "Aren't your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them." He said to him, "Here I am."
verse:37:14 He said to him, "Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers, and well with the flock; and bring me word again." So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. 
verse:37:15 A certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. The man asked him, "What are you looking for?"
verse:37:16 He said, "I am looking for my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are feeding the flock."
verse:37:17 The man said, "They have left here, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'"
Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan. 
verse:37:18 They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him. 
verse:37:19 They said one to another, "Behold, this dreamer comes. 
verse:37:20 Come now therefore, and let's kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, 'An evil animal has devoured him.' We will see what will become of his dreams."
verse:37:21 Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, "Let's not take his life." 
verse:37:22 Reuben said to them, "Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand on him"--that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.

verse:37:23 It happened, when Joseph came to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him; 
verse:37:24 and they took him, and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty. There was no water in it.
verse:37:25 They sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. 
verse:37:26 Judah said to his brothers, "What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? 
verse:37:27 Come, and let's sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not let our hand be on him; for he is our brother, our flesh." His brothers listened to him. 
verse:37:28 Midianites who were merchants passed by, and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. They brought Joseph into Egypt.
verse:37:29 Reuben returned to the pit; and saw that Joseph wasn't in the pit; and he tore his clothes. 
verse:37:30 He returned to his brothers, and said, "The child is no more; and I, where will I go?" 
verse:37:31 They took Joseph's coat, and killed a male goat, and dipped the coat in the blood. 
verse:37:32 They took the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, "We have found this. Examine it, now, whether it is your son's coat or not."
verse:37:33 He recognized it, and said, "It is my son's coat. An evil animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces." 
verse:37:34 Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days. 
verse:37:35 All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He said, "For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning." His father wept for him. 
verse:37:36 The Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.
portion:Genesis 38:1 - 38:30
verse:38:1 It happened at that time, that Judah went down from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 
verse:38:2 Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. He took her, and went in to her. 
verse:38:3 She conceived, and bore a son; and he named him Er. 
verse:38:4 She conceived again, and bore a son; and she named him Onan. 
verse:38:5 She yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him. 
verse:38:6 Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. 
verse:38:7 Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of HASHEM. HASHEM killed him. 
verse:38:8 Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her, and raise up seed to your brother." 
verse:38:9 Onan knew that the seed wouldn't be his; and it happened, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother. 
verse:38:10 The thing which he did was evil in the sight of HASHEM, and he killed him also. 
verse:38:11 Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow in your father's house, until Shelah, my son, is grown up;" for he said, "Lest he also die, like his brothers." Tamar went and lived in her father's house.
verse:38:12 After many days, Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite. 
verse:38:13 It was told Tamar, saying, "Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep." 
verse:38:14 She took off of her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn't given to him as a wife. 
verse:38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. 
verse:38:16 He turned to her by the way, and said, "Please come, let me come in to you," for he didn't know that she was his daughter-in-law.
She said, "What will you give me, that you may come in to me?"
verse:38:17 He said, "I will send you a young goat from the flock."
She said, "Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?"
verse:38:18 He said, "What pledge will I give you?"
She said, "Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand."
He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him. 
verse:38:19 She arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. 
verse:38:20 Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand, but he didn't find her. 
verse:38:21 Then he asked the men of her place, saying, "Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the road?"
They said, "There has been no prostitute here."
verse:38:22 He returned to Judah, and said, "I haven't found her; and also the men of the place said, 'There has been no prostitute here.'" 
verse:38:23 Judah said, "Let her keep it, lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this young goat, and you haven't found her."
verse:38:24 It happened about three months later, that it was told Judah, saying, "Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has played the prostitute; and moreover, behold, she is with child by prostitution."
Judah said, "Bring her out, and let her be burnt." 
verse:38:25 When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, "By the man, whose these are, I am with child." She also said, "Please discern whose are these--the signet, and the cords, and the staff."
verse:38:26 Judah acknowledged them, and said, "She is more righteous than I, because I didn't give her to Shelah, my son."
He knew her again no more. 
verse:38:27 It happened in the time of her travail, that behold, twins were in her womb. 
verse:38:28 When she travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, "This came out first." 
verse:38:29 It happened, as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out, and she said, "Why have you made a breach for yourself?" Therefore his name was called Perez. 
verse:38:30 Afterward his brother came out, that had the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.

verse:39:1 Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there. 
verse:39:2 HASHEM was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 
verse:39:3 His master saw that HASHEM was with him, and that HASHEM made all that he did prosper in his hand. 
verse:39:4 Joseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. 
verse:39:5 It happened from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that HASHEM blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of HASHEM was on all that he had, in the house and in the field. 
verse:39:6 He left all that he had in Joseph's hand. He didn't concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate.
Joseph was well-built and handsome.
portion:Genesis 39:7 - 39:23
verse:39:7 It happened after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph; and she said, "Lie with me."
verse:39:8 But he refused, and said to his master's wife, "Behold, my master doesn't know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand. 
verse:39:9 He isn't greater in this house than I, neither has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
verse:39:10 As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he didn't listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her. 
verse:39:11 About this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside. 
verse:39:12 She caught him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me!"
He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside. 
verse:39:13 When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside, 
verse:39:14 she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, "Behold, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice. 
verse:39:15 It happened, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and ran outside." 
verse:39:16 She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home. 
verse:39:17 She spoke to him according to these words, saying, "The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me, 
verse:39:18 and it happened, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and ran outside."
verse:39:19 It happened, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, "This is what your servant did to me," that his wrath was kindled. 
verse:39:20 Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody. 
verse:39:21 But HASHEM was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. 
verse:39:22 The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it. 
verse:39:23 The keeper of the prison didn't look after anything that was under his hand, because HASHEM was with him; and that which he did, HASHEM made it prosper.

verse:40:1 It happened after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord, the king of Egypt. 
verse:40:2 Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. 
verse:40:3 He put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. 
verse:40:4 The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he took care of them. They stayed in prison many days. 
verse:40:5 They both dreamed a dream, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison. 
verse:40:6 Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad. 
verse:40:7 He asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody in his master's house, saying, "Why do you look so sad today?"
verse:40:8 They said to him, "We have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it."
Joseph said to them, "Don't interpretations belong to God? Please tell it to me."
verse:40:9 The chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, "In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me, 
verse:40:10 and in the vine were three branches. It was as though it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters produced ripe grapes. 
verse:40:11 Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
verse:40:12 Joseph said to him, "This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days. 
verse:40:13 Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, and restore you to your office. You will give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, the way you did when you were his cupbearer. 
verse:40:14 But remember me when it will be well with you, and please show kindness to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house. 
verse:40:15 For indeed, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon."
verse:40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, "I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head. 
verse:40:17 In the uppermost basket there was all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head."
verse:40:18 Joseph answered, "This is its interpretation. The three baskets are three days. 
verse:40:19 Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you, and will hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you." 
verse:40:20 It happened the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants. 
verse:40:21 He restored the chief cupbearer to his position again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand; 
verse:40:22 but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them. 
verse:40:23 Yet the chief cupbearer didn't remember Joseph, but forgot him.

verse:41:1 It happened at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and behold, he stood by the river. 
verse:41:2 Behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, sleek and fat, and they fed in the marsh grass. 
verse:41:3 Behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river, ugly and thin, and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river. 
verse:41:4 The ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke. 
verse:41:5 He slept and dreamed a second time: and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and good. 
verse:41:6 Behold, seven heads of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. 
verse:41:7 The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. 
verse:41:8 It happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all of Egypt's magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
verse:41:9 Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, "I remember my faults today. 
verse:41:10 Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker. 
verse:41:11 We dreamed a dream in one night, I and he. We dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. 
verse:41:12 There was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. To each man according to his dream he interpreted. 
verse:41:13 It happened, as he interpreted to us, so it was: he restored me to my office, and he hanged him."
verse:41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. He shaved himself, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh.

verse:41:15 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."
verse:41:16 Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, "It isn't in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace."
verse:41:17 Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, "In my dream, behold, I stood on the brink of the river: 
verse:41:18 and behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, fat and sleek. They fed in the marsh grass, 
verse:41:19 and behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness. 
verse:41:20 The thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle, 
verse:41:21 and when they had eaten them up, it couldn't be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke. 
verse:41:22 I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good: 
verse:41:23 and behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. 
verse:41:24 The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me."
verse:41:25 Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh. 
verse:41:26 The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads of grain are seven years. The dream is one. 
verse:41:27 The seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine. 
verse:41:28 That is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh. What God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh. 
verse:41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt. 
verse:41:30 There will arise after them seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land, 
verse:41:31 and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous. 
verse:41:32 The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
verse:41:33 "Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt. 
verse:41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt's produce in the seven plenteous years. 
verse:41:35 Let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. 
verse:41:36 The food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; that the land not perish through the famine."
verse:41:37 The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. 
verse:41:38 Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?"

verse:41:40 You shall be over my house, and according to your word will all my people be ruled. Only in the throne I will be greater than you." 
verse:41:41 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt." 
verse:41:42 Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck, 
verse:41:43 and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had. They cried before him, "Bow the knee!" He set him over all the land of Egypt. 
verse:41:44 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, and without you shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt." 
verse:41:45 Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-Paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife. Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
verse:41:46 Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. 
verse:41:47 In the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly. 
verse:41:48 He gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was around every city, he laid up in the same. 
verse:41:49 Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped counting, for it was without number. 
verse:41:50 To Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him. 
verse:41:51 Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, "For," he said, "God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house."

verse:41:53 The seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt, came to an end. 
verse:41:54 The seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 
verse:41:55 When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do." 
verse:41:56 The famine was over all the surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt. 
verse:41:57 All countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.
verse:42:1 Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, "Why do you look at one another?" 
verse:42:2 He said, "Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die." 
verse:42:3 Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. 
verse:42:4 But Jacob didn't send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers; for he said, "Lest perhaps harm happen to him." 
verse:42:5 The sons of Israel came to buy among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan. 
verse:42:6 Joseph was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. Joseph's brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth. 
verse:42:7 Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them. He said to them, "Where did you come from?"
They said, "From the land of Canaan to buy food."
verse:42:8 Joseph recognized his brothers, but they didn't recognize him. 
verse:42:9 Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them, and said to them, "You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land."
verse:42:10 They said to him, "No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. 
verse:42:11 We are all one man's sons; we are honest men. Your servants are not spies."
verse:42:12 He said to them, "No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land!"
verse:42:13 They said, "We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more."
verse:42:14 Joseph said to them, "It is like I told you, saying, 'You are spies!' 
verse:42:15 By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go out from here, unless your youngest brother comes here. 
verse:42:16 Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies." 
verse:42:17 He put them all together into custody for three days.
verse:42:18 Joseph said to them the third day, "Do this, and live, for I fear God.

verse:42:20 Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you won't die."
They did so. 
verse:42:21 They said one to another, "We are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn't listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us." 
verse:42:22 Reuben answered them, saying, "Didn't I tell you, saying, 'Don't sin against the child,' and you wouldn't listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required." 
verse:42:23 They didn't know that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them. 
verse:42:24 He turned himself away from them, and wept. Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes. 
verse:42:25 Then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore each man's money into his sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them.
verse:42:26 They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there. 
verse:42:27 As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack. 
verse:42:28 He said to his brothers, "My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!" Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, "What is this that God has done to us?" 
verse:42:29 They came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying, 
verse:42:30 "The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country. 
verse:42:31 We said to him, 'We are honest men. We are no spies. 
verse:42:32 We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.' 
verse:42:33 The man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way. 
verse:42:34 Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.'"
verse:42:35 It happened as they emptied their sacks, that behold, each man's bundle of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. 
verse:42:36 Jacob, their father, said to them, "You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these things are against me."
verse:42:37 Reuben spoke to his father, saying, "Kill my two sons, if I don't bring him to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again."
verse:42:38 He said, "My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol."
verse:43:1 The famine was severe in the land. 
verse:43:2 It happened, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, "Go again, buy us a little more food."
verse:43:3 Judah spoke to him, saying, "The man solemnly warned us, saying, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.' 
verse:43:4 If you'll send our brother with us, we'll go down and buy you food, 
verse:43:5 but if you'll not send him, we'll not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.'"
verse:43:6 Israel said, "Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another brother?"
verse:43:7 They said, "The man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?' We just answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down?'"
verse:43:8 Judah said to Israel, his father, "Send the boy with me, and we'll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones. 
verse:43:9 I'll be collateral for him. From my hand will you require him. If I don't bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever, 
verse:43:10 for if we hadn't delayed, surely we would have returned a second time by now."
verse:43:11 Their father, Israel, said to them, "If it must be so, then do this. Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds; 
verse:43:12 and take double money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight. 
verse:43:13 Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man. 
verse:43:14 May God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
verse:43:15 The men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
portion:Genesis 43:16 - 43:29
verse:43:16 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, "Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal, and prepare; for the men will dine with me at noon."
verse:43:17 The man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph's house. 
verse:43:18 The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, "Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, we're brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our donkeys." 
verse:43:19 They came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house, 
verse:43:20 and said, "Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food. 
verse:43:21 When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and behold, each man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our hand. 
verse:43:22 We have brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We don't know who put our money in our sacks."
verse:43:23 He said, "Peace be to you. Don't be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money." He brought Simeon out to them. 
verse:43:24 The man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder. 
verse:43:25 They prepared the present for Joseph's coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.
verse:43:26 When Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to him to the earth. 
verse:43:27 He asked them of their welfare, and said, "Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?"
verse:43:28 They said, "Your servant, our father, is well. He is still alive." They bowed down humbly. 
verse:43:29 He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother's son, and said, "Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?" He said, "God be gracious to you, my son."
portion:Genesis 43:30 - 44:17
verse:43:30 Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep. He entered into his room, and wept there. 
verse:43:31 He washed his face, and came out. He controlled himself, and said, "Serve the meal."
verse:43:32 They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians, that ate with him, by themselves, because the Egyptians don't eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians. 
verse:43:33 They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth, and the men marveled one with another. 
verse:43:34 He sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. They drank, and were merry with him.
verse:44:1 He commanded the steward of his house, saying, "Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in his sack's mouth. 
verse:44:2 Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, with his grain money." He did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. 
verse:44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. 
verse:44:4 When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, "Up, follow after the men. When you overtake them, ask them, 'Why have you rewarded evil for good? 
verse:44:5 Isn't this that from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You have done evil in so doing.'" 
verse:44:6 He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them.
verse:44:7 They said to him, "Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing! 
verse:44:8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan. How then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord's house? 
verse:44:9 With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondservants."
verse:44:10 He said, "Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found will be my bondservant; and you will be blameless."
verse:44:11 Then they hurried, and each man took his sack down to the ground, and each man opened his sack. 
verse:44:12 He searched, beginning with the eldest, and ending at the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin's sack. 
verse:44:13 Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city.
verse:44:14 Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, and he was still there. They fell on the ground before him. 
verse:44:15 Joseph said to them, "What deed is this that you have done? Don't you know that such a man as I can indeed divine?"
verse:44:16 Judah said, "What will we tell my lord? What will we speak? Or how will we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we are my lord's bondservants, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found."
verse:44:17 He said, "Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my bondservant; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.
portion:Genesis 44:15 - 44:17
verse:44:15 Joseph said to them, "What deed is this that you have done? Don't you know that such a man as I can indeed divine?"
verse:44:16 Judah said, "What will we tell my lord? What will we speak? Or how will we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we are my lord's bondservants, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found."
verse:44:17 He said, "Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my bondservant; but as for you, go up in peace to your father."
portion:Genesis 44:18 - 44:30
verse:44:18 Then Judah came near to him, and said, "Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears, and don't let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh. 
verse:44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father, or a brother?' 
verse:44:20 We said to my lord, 'We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him.' 
verse:44:21 You said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.' 
verse:44:22 We said to my lord, 'The boy can't leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.' 
verse:44:23 You said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will see my face no more.' 
verse:44:24 It happened when we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. 
verse:44:25 Our father said, 'Go again, buy us a little food.' 
verse:44:26 We said, 'We can't go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down: for we may not see the man's face, unless our youngest brother is with us.' 
verse:44:27 Your servant, my father, said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons: 
verse:44:28 and the one went out from me, and I said, "Surely he is torn in pieces;" and I haven't seen him since. 
verse:44:29 If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.' 
verse:44:30 Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us; since his life is bound up in the boy's life;
portion:Genesis 44:31 - 45:7
verse:44:31 it will happen, when he sees that the boy is no more, that he will die. Your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant, our father, with sorrow to Sheol. 
verse:44:32 For your servant became collateral for the boy to my father, saying, 'If I don't bring him to you, then I will bear the blame to my father forever.' 
verse:44:33 Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the boy, a bondservant to my lord; and let the boy go up with his brothers. 
verse:44:34 For how will I go up to my father, if the boy isn't with me?--lest I see the evil that will come on my father."
verse:45:1 Then Joseph couldn't control himself before all those who stood before him, and he cried, "Cause everyone to go out from me!" No one else stood with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brothers. 
verse:45:2 He wept aloud. The Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard. 
verse:45:3 Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Does my father still live?"
His brothers couldn't answer him; for they were terrified at his presence. 
verse:45:4 Joseph said to his brothers, "Come near to me, please."
They came near. "He said, I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. 
verse:45:5 Now don't be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life. 
verse:45:6 For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest. 
verse:45:7 God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.
portion:Genesis 45:8 - 45:18
verse:45:8 So now it wasn't you who sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt. 
verse:45:9 Hurry, and go up to my father, and tell him, 'This is what your son Joseph says, "God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me. Don't wait. 
verse:45:10 You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be near to me, you, your children, your children's children, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have. 
verse:45:11 There I will nourish you; for there are yet five years of famine; lest you come to poverty, you, and your household, and all that you have."' 
verse:45:12 Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you. 
verse:45:13 You shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. You shall hurry and bring my father down here." 
verse:45:14 He fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck. 
verse:45:15 He kissed all his brothers, and wept on them. After that his brothers talked with him.
verse:45:16 The report of it was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, "Joseph's brothers have come." It pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. 
verse:45:17 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers, 'Do this. Load your animals, and go, travel to the land of Canaan. 
verse:45:18 Take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.' 
portion:Genesis 45:19 - 45:27
verse:45:19 Now you are commanded: do this. Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. 
verse:45:20 Also, don't concern yourselves about your belongings, for the good of all of the land of Egypt is yours."
verse:45:21 The sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. 
verse:45:22 He gave each one of them changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing. 
verse:45:23 He sent the following to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way. 
verse:45:24 So he sent his brothers away, and they departed. He said to them, "See that you don't quarrel on the way."
verse:45:25 They went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father. 
verse:45:26 They told him, saying, "Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt." His heart fainted, for he didn't believe them. 
verse:45:27 They told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them. When he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived. 
portion:Genesis 45:28 - 46:27
verse:45:28 Israel said, "It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."
verse:46:1 Israel traveled with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father, Isaac. 
verse:46:2 God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, "Jacob, Jacob!"
He said, "Here I am."
verse:46:3 He said, "I am God, the God of your father. Don't be afraid to go down into Egypt, for there I will make of you a great nation. 
verse:46:4 I will go down with you into Egypt. I will also surely bring you up again. Joseph will close your eyes."
verse:46:5 Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob, their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 
verse:46:6 They took their livestock, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt--Jacob, and all his seed with him, 
verse:46:7 his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and he brought all his seed with him into Egypt.
verse:46:8 These are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.

verse:46:11 The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

verse:46:27 The sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, were seventy.
portion:Genesis 46:28 - 47:10
verse:46:28 He sent Judah before him to Joseph, to show the way before him to Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen. 
verse:46:29 Joseph prepared his chariot, and went up to meet Israel, his father, in Goshen. He presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. 
verse:46:30 Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive."
verse:46:31 Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father's house, "I will go up, and speak with Pharaoh, and will tell him, 'My brothers, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me. 
verse:46:32 These men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock, and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.' 
verse:46:33 It will happen, when Pharaoh summons you, and will say, 'What is your occupation?' 
verse:46:34 that you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers:' that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians."
verse:47:1 Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, "My father and my brothers, with their flocks, their herds, and all that they own, have come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen." 
verse:47:2 From among his brothers he took five men, and presented them to Pharaoh. 
verse:47:3 Pharaoh said to his brothers, "What is your occupation?"
They said to Pharaoh, "Your servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers." 
verse:47:4 They said to Pharaoh, "We have come to live as foreigners in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks. For the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen."
verse:47:5 Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, "Your father and your brothers have come to you. 
verse:47:6 The land of Egypt is before you. Make your father and your brothers dwell in the best of the land. Let them dwell in the land of Goshen. If you know any able men among them, then put them in charge of my livestock."
verse:47:7 Joseph brought in Jacob, his father, and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
verse:47:8 Pharaoh said to Jacob, "How many are the days of the years of your life?"
verse:47:9 Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage." 
verse:47:10 Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
portion:Genesis 47:11 - 47:27
verse:47:11 Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 
verse:47:12 Joseph nourished his father, his brothers, and all of his father's household, with bread, according to their families.
verse:47:13 There was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. 
verse:47:14 Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. 
verse:47:15 When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, "Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For our money fails."
verse:47:16 Joseph said, "Give me your livestock; and I will give you food for your livestock, if your money is gone."
verse:47:17 They brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year. 
verse:47:18 When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, "We will not hide from my lord how our money is all spent, and the herds of livestock are my lord's. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands. 
verse:47:19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land won't be desolate."
verse:47:20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every man of the Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe on them, and the land became Pharaoh's. 
verse:47:21 As for the people, he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it. 
verse:47:22 Only he didn't buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they didn't sell their land. 
verse:47:23 Then Joseph said to the people, "Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land. 
verse:47:24 It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for food for your little ones."
verse:47:25 They said, "You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."
verse:47:26 Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone didn't become Pharaoh's.
verse:47:27 Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got themselves possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.

verse:47:28 Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years. 
verse:47:29 The time drew near that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, "If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please don't bury me in Egypt, 
verse:47:30 but when I sleep with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place."
He said, "I will do as you have said."
verse:47:31 He said, "Swear to me," and he swore to him. Israel bowed himself on the bed's head.
verse:48:1 It happened after these things, that someone said to Joseph, "Behold, your father is sick." He took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.

verse:50:5 'My father made me swear, saying, "Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan." Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come again.'"

verse:50:12 His sons did to him just as he commanded them, 
verse:50:13 for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burial site, from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre. 
verse:50:14 Joseph returned into Egypt--he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
verse:50:15 When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all of the evil which we did to him." 
verse:50:16 They sent a message to Joseph, saying, "Your father commanded before he died, saying, 
verse:50:17 'You shall tell Joseph, "Now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers, and their sin, because they did evil to you."' Now, please forgive the disobedience of the servants of the God of your father." Joseph wept when they spoke to him. 
verse:50:18 His brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, "Behold, we are your servants." 
verse:50:19 Joseph said to them, "Don't be afraid, for am I in the place of God?

verse:1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 
verse:1:4 Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. 
verse:1:5 All the souls who came out of Jacob's body were seventy souls, and Joseph was in Egypt already. 
verse:1:6 Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation. 
verse:1:7 The children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.
verse:1:8 Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who didn't know Joseph. 
verse:1:9 He said to his people, "Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we. 
verse:1:10 Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and escape out of the land." 
verse:1:11 Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses. 
verse:1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They were grieved because of the children of Israel. 
verse:1:13 The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve, 
verse:1:14 and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all kinds of service in the field, all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve.
verse:1:15 The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah, 
verse:1:16 and he said, "When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birth stool; if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live."

verse:1:18 The king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, "Why have you done this thing, and have saved the boys alive?"
verse:1:19 The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women aren't like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous, and give birth before the midwife comes to them."
verse:1:20 God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty. 
verse:1:21 It happened, because the midwives feared God, that he gave them families. 
verse:1:22 Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, "You shall cast every son who is born into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive."
verse:2:1 A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as his wife. 
verse:2:2 The woman conceived, and bore a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months. 
verse:2:3 When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and coated it with tar and with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river's bank. 
verse:2:4 His sister stood far off, to see what would be done to him. 
verse:2:5 Pharaoh's daughter came down to bathe at the river. Her maidens walked along by the riverside. She saw the basket among the reeds, and sent her handmaid to get it. 
verse:2:6 She opened it, and saw the child, and behold, the baby cried. She had compassion on him, and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children."
verse:2:7 Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?"
verse:2:8 Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go."
The maiden went and called the child's mother. 
verse:2:9 Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages."
The woman took the child, and nursed it. 
verse:2:10 The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, and said, "Because I drew him out of the water."
portion:Exodus 2:11 - 2:25
verse:2:11 It happened in those days, when Moses had grown up, that he went out to his brothers, and looked at their burdens. He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers. 
verse:2:12 He looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one, he killed the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
verse:2:13 He went out the second day, and behold, two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other. He said to him who did the wrong, "Why do you strike your fellow?"
verse:2:14 He said, "Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?"
Moses was afraid, and said, "Surely this thing is known." 
verse:2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.
verse:2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. 
verse:2:17 The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 
verse:2:18 When they came to Reuel, their father, he said, "How is it that you have returned so early today?"
verse:2:19 They said, "An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock."
verse:2:20 He said to his daughters, "Where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread."
verse:2:21 Moses was content to dwell with the man. He gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter. 
verse:2:22 She bore a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, "I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land."
verse:2:23 It happened in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.

He said, "Here I am."
verse:3:5 He said, "Don't come close. Take your sandals off of your feet, for the place you are standing on is holy ground." 
verse:3:6 Moreover he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."
Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look at God.
verse:3:7 HASHEM said, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows. 
verse:3:8 I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
verse:3:9 Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. 
verse:3:10 Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt."
verse:3:11 Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?"
verse:3:12 He said, "Certainly I will be with you. This will be the token to you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain."
verse:3:13 Moses said to God, "Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you;' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' What should I tell them?"

verse:3:17 and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey."'

verse:3:19 I know that the king of Egypt won't give you permission to go, no, not by a mighty hand. 
verse:3:20 I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in its midst, and after that he will let you go.

verse:3:22 But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who visits her house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing; and you shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters. You shall plunder the Egyptians."

verse:4:2 HASHEM said to him, "What is that in your hand?"
He said, "A rod."
verse:4:3 He said, "Throw it on the ground."
He threw it on the ground, and it became a snake; and Moses ran away from it.
verse:4:4 HASHEM said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand, and take it by the tail."
He stretched out his hand, and took hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand.
verse:4:5 "That they may believe that HASHEM, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you." 
verse:4:6 HASHEM said furthermore to him, "Now put your hand inside your cloak."
He put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.
verse:4:7 He said, "Put your hand inside your cloak again."
He put his hand inside his cloak again, and when he took it out of his cloak, behold, it had turned again as his other flesh.
verse:4:8 "It will happen, if they will neither believe you nor listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. 
verse:4:9 It will happen, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither listen to your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land."
verse:4:10 Moses said to HASHEM, "O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before now, nor since you have spoken to your servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue."
verse:4:11 HASHEM said to him, "Who made man's mouth? Or who makes one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Isn't it I, HASHEM? 
verse:4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall speak."
verse:4:13 He said, "Oh, my Lord, please send someone else."
verse:4:14 The anger of HASHEM was kindled against Moses, and he said, "What about Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Also, behold, he comes out to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart. 
verse:4:15 You shall speak to him, and put the words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.

verse:4:20 Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. Moses took God's rod in his hand. 
verse:4:21 HASHEM said to Moses, "When you go back into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand, but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go. 
verse:4:22 You shall tell Pharaoh, 'Thus says HASHEM, Israel is my son, my firstborn, 
verse:4:23 and I have said to you, "Let my son go, that he may serve me;" and you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn.'"

verse:4:25 Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me."
verse:4:26 So he let him alone. Then she said, "You are a bridegroom of blood," because of the circumcision.

verse:5:11 Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished.'" 
verse:5:12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 
verse:5:13 The taskmasters were urgent saying, "Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was straw!" 
verse:5:14 The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, "Why haven't you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today, in making brick as before?"
verse:5:15 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you deal this way with your servants? 
verse:5:16 No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, 'Make brick!' and behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people."
verse:5:17 But he said, "You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to HASHEM.' 
verse:5:18 Go therefore now, and work, for no straw shall be given to you, yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks!"
verse:5:19 The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble, when it was said, "You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!"
verse:5:20 They met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came out from Pharaoh: 
verse:5:21 and they said to them, "May HASHEM look at you, and judge, because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us."
verse:5:22 Moses returned to HASHEM, and said, "My Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why is it that you have sent me? 
verse:5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people; neither have you delivered your people at all."
verse:6:1 HASHEM said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh, for by a strong hand he shall let them go, and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land."

verse:6:2 God spoke to Moses, and said to him, "I am HASHEM; 
verse:6:3 and I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name HASHEM I was not known to them. 
verse:6:4 I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they lived as aliens. 
verse:6:5 Moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant. 
verse:6:6 Therefore tell the children of Israel, 'I am HASHEM, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments: 
verse:6:7 and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and you shall know that I am HASHEM your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 
verse:6:8 I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am HASHEM.'"
verse:6:9 Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they didn't listen to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
verse:6:10 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:6:11 "Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land."
verse:6:12 Moses spoke before HASHEM, saying, "Behold, the children of Israel haven't listened to me. How then shall Pharaoh listen to me, who am of uncircumcised lips?" 
verse:6:13 HASHEM spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a command to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

verse:6:28 It happened on the day when HASHEM spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, 
portion:Exodus 6:29 - 7:7
verse:6:29 that HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, "I am HASHEM. Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you." 
verse:6:30 Moses said before HASHEM, "Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh listen to me?"
verse:7:1 HASHEM said to Moses, "Behold, I have made you as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet. 
verse:7:2 You shall speak all that I command you; and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. 
verse:7:3 I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 
verse:7:4 But Pharaoh will not listen to you, and I will lay my hand on Egypt, and bring out my armies, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. 
verse:7:5 The Egyptians shall know that I am HASHEM, when I stretch out my hand on Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them."
verse:7:6 Moses and Aaron did so. As HASHEM commanded them, so they did. 
verse:7:7 Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
portion:Exodus 7:8 - 8:6
verse:7:8 HASHEM spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
verse:7:9 "When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, 'Perform a miracle!' then you shall tell Aaron, 'Take your rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.'"
verse:7:10 Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, as HASHEM had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 
verse:7:11 Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers. They also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same thing with their enchantments. 
verse:7:12 For they each cast down their rods, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. 
verse:7:13 Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them; as HASHEM had spoken.
verse:7:14 HASHEM said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is stubborn. He refuses to let the people go. 
verse:7:15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning. Behold, he goes out to the water; and you shall stand by the river's bank to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand. 
verse:7:16 You shall tell him, 'HASHEM, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, "Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness:" and behold, until now you haven't listened. 
verse:7:17 Thus says HASHEM, "In this you shall know that I am HASHEM. Behold, I will strike with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. 
verse:7:18 The fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river."'" 
verse:7:19 HASHEM said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Take your rod, and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.'"
verse:7:20 Moses and Aaron did so, as HASHEM commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and struck the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. 
verse:7:21 The fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians couldn't drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt. 
verse:7:22 The magicians of Egypt did the same thing with their enchantments; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them; as HASHEM had spoken. 
verse:7:23 Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he didn't even take this to heart. 
verse:7:24 All the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink; for they couldn't drink of the water of the river. 
verse:7:25 Seven days were fulfilled, after HASHEM had struck the river.
verse:7:26 HASHEM spoke to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, "This is what HASHEM says, 'Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
verse:7:27 If you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your borders with frogs: 
verse:7:28 and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your bedroom, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs: 
verse:7:29 and the frogs shall come up both on you, and on your people, and on all your servants.'" 
verse:8:1 HASHEM said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.'" 
verse:8:2 Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 
verse:8:3 The magicians did the same thing with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.
verse:8:4 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, "Entreat HASHEM, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to HASHEM."
verse:8:5 Moses said to Pharaoh, "I give you the honor of setting the time that I should pray for you, and for your servants, and for your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses, and remain in the river only."
verse:8:6 He said, "Tomorrow."
He said, "Be it according to your word, that you may know that there is none like HASHEM our God.
portion:Exodus 8:7 - 8:18
verse:8:7 The frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people. They shall remain in the river only."
verse:8:8 Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to HASHEM concerning the frogs which he had brought on Pharaoh. 
verse:8:9 HASHEM did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields. 
verse:8:10 They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank. 
verse:8:11 But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart, and didn't listen to them, as HASHEM had spoken.
verse:8:12 HASHEM said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.'" 
verse:8:13 They did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were lice on man, and on animal; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 
verse:8:14 The magicians tried with their enchantments to produce lice, but they couldn't. There were lice on man, and on animal. 
verse:8:15 Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God:" and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them; as HASHEM had spoken.
verse:8:16 HASHEM said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; behold, he comes out to the water; and tell him, 'This is what HASHEM says, "Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
verse:8:17 Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are. 
verse:8:18 I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end you may know that I am HASHEM in the midst of the earth.
portion:Exodus 8:19 - 9:16
verse:8:19 I will put a division between my people and your people: by tomorrow shall this sign be."'" 
verse:8:20 HASHEM did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses: and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies.
verse:8:21 Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God in the land!"
verse:8:22 Moses said, "It isn't appropriate to do so; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to HASHEM our God. Behold, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and won't they stone us? 
verse:8:23 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to HASHEM our God, as he shall command us."
verse:8:24 Pharaoh said, "I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to HASHEM your God in the wilderness, only you shall not go very far away. Pray for me."
verse:8:25 Moses said, "Behold, I go out from you, and I will pray to HASHEM that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only don't let Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to HASHEM." 
verse:8:26 Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to HASHEM. 
verse:8:27 HASHEM did according to the word of Moses, and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. There remained not one. 
verse:8:28 Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he didn't let the people go.
verse:9:1 Then HASHEM said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, 'This is what HASHEM, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
verse:9:2 For if you refuse to let them go, and hold them still, 
verse:9:3 behold, the hand of HASHEM is on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence. 
verse:9:4 HASHEM will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt; and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel."'" 
verse:9:5 HASHEM appointed a set time, saying, "Tomorrow HASHEM shall do this thing in the land." 
verse:9:6 HASHEM did that thing on the next day; and all the livestock of Egypt died, but of the livestock of the children of Israel, not one died. 
verse:9:7 Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he didn't let the people go.
verse:9:8 HASHEM said to Moses and to Aaron, "Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh. 
verse:9:9 It shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal, throughout all the land of Egypt."
verse:9:10 They took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky; and it became a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal. 
verse:9:11 The magicians couldn't stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were on the magicians, and on all the Egyptians. 
verse:9:12 HASHEM hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he didn't listen to them, as HASHEM had spoken to Moses.
verse:9:13 HASHEM said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, 'This is what HASHEM, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
verse:9:14 For this time I will send all my plagues against your heart, against your officials, and against your people; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth. 
verse:9:15 For now I would have stretched out my hand, and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth; 
verse:9:16 but indeed for this cause I have made you stand: to show you my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth;
portion:Exodus 9:17 - 9:35
verse:9:17 as you still exalt yourself against my people, that you won't let them go. 
verse:9:18 Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now. 
verse:9:19 Now therefore command that all of your livestock and all that you have in the field be brought into shelter. Every man and animal that is found in the field, and isn't brought home, the hail shall come down on them, and they shall die."'"
verse:9:20 Those who feared the word of HASHEM among the servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their livestock flee into the houses. 
verse:9:21 Whoever didn't respect the word of HASHEM left his servants and his livestock in the field.
verse:9:22 HASHEM said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man, and on animal, and on every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt."
verse:9:23 Moses stretched out his rod toward the heavens, and HASHEM sent thunder, hail, and lightning flashed down to the earth. HASHEM rained hail on the land of Egypt. 
verse:9:24 So there was very severe hail, and lightning mixed with the hail, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 
verse:9:25 The hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and animal; and the hail struck every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field. 
verse:9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.
verse:9:27 Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, "I have sinned this time. HASHEM is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. 
verse:9:28 Pray to HASHEM; for there has been enough of mighty thunderings and hail. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer."
verse:9:29 Moses said to him, "As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to HASHEM. The thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that you may know that the earth is HASHEM's. 
verse:9:30 But as for you and your servants, I know that you don't yet fear HASHEM God."
verse:9:31 The flax and the barley were struck, for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom. 
verse:9:32 But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they had not grown up. 
verse:9:33 Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to HASHEM; and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth. 
verse:9:34 When Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. 
verse:9:35 The heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he didn't let the children of Israel go, just as HASHEM had spoken through Moses.

verse:10:2 and that you may tell in the hearing of your son, and of your son's son, what things I have done to Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that you may know that I am HASHEM."
verse:10:3 Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him, "This is what HASHEM, the God of the Hebrews, says: 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
verse:10:4 Or else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country, 
verse:10:5 and they shall cover the surface of the earth, so that one won't be able to see the earth. They shall eat the residue of that which has escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field. 
verse:10:6 Your houses shall be filled, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither your fathers nor your fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day.'" He turned, and went out from Pharaoh.
verse:10:7 Pharaoh's servants said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve HASHEM, their God. Don't you yet know that Egypt is destroyed?"
verse:10:8 Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, "Go, serve HASHEM your God; but who are those who will go?"
verse:10:9 Moses said, "We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to HASHEM."
verse:10:10 He said to them, "HASHEM be with you if I will let you go with your little ones! See, evil is clearly before your faces. 
verse:10:11 Not so! Go now you who are men, and serve HASHEM; for that is what you desire!" They were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.

verse:10:12 HASHEM said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left." 
verse:10:13 Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt, and HASHEM brought an east wind on the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. 
verse:10:14 The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt. They were very grievous. Before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such. 
verse:10:15 For they covered the surface of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened, and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. There remained nothing green, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt. 
verse:10:16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said, "I have sinned against HASHEM your God, and against you. 
verse:10:17 Now therefore please forgive my sin again, and pray to HASHEM your God, that he may also take away from me this death."
verse:10:18 He went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to HASHEM. 
verse:10:19 HASHEM turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Sea of Suf. There remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt. 
verse:10:20 But HASHEM hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he didn't let the children of Israel go.
verse:10:21 HASHEM said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt." 
verse:10:22 Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days. 
verse:10:23 They didn't see one another, neither did anyone rise from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.

verse:10:26 Our livestock also shall go with us. Not a hoof shall be left behind, for of it we must take to serve HASHEM our God; and we don't know with what we must serve HASHEM, until we come there."
verse:10:27 But HASHEM hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he wouldn't let them go. 
verse:10:28 Pharaoh said to him, "Get away from me! Be careful to see my face no more; for in the day you see my face you shall die!"
verse:10:29 Moses said, "You have spoken well. I will see your face again no more."
verse:11:1 HASHEM said to Moses, "Yet one plague more will I bring on Pharaoh, and on Egypt; afterwards he will let you go. When he lets you go, he will surely thrust you out altogether. 
verse:11:2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold."

verse:11:7 But against any of the children of Israel a dog won't even bark or move its tongue, against man or animal; that you may know that HASHEM makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel. 
verse:11:8 All these your servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, "Get out, with all the people who follow you;" and after that I will go out.'" He went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
verse:11:9 HASHEM said to Moses, "Pharaoh won't listen to you, that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt."

verse:12:9 Don't eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire; with its head, its legs and its inner parts. 
verse:12:10 You shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire. 
verse:12:11 This is how you shall eat it: with your belt on your waist, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste: it is HASHEM's Passover. 
verse:12:12 For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and animal. Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am HASHEM. 
verse:12:13 The blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be on you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt. 
verse:12:14 This day shall be to you for a memorial, and you shall keep it a feast to HASHEM: throughout your generations you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever.
verse:12:15 "'Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. 
verse:12:16 In the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no kind of work shall be done in them, except that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you. 
verse:12:17 You shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever. 
verse:12:18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty first day of the month at evening. 
verse:12:19 There shall be no yeast found in your houses for seven days, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a foreigner, or one who is born in the land. 
verse:12:20 You shall eat nothing leavened. In all your habitations you shall eat unleavened bread.'"
portion:Exodus 12:21 - 12:28
verse:12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, "Draw out, and take lambs according to your families, and kill the Passover. 
verse:12:22 You shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning. 
verse:12:23 For HASHEM will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two doorposts, HASHEM will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you. 
verse:12:24 You shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons forever. 
verse:12:25 It shall happen when you have come to the land which HASHEM will give you, according as he has promised, that you shall keep this service. 
verse:12:26 It will happen, when your children ask you, 'What do you mean by this service?' 
verse:12:27 that you shall say, 'It is the sacrifice of HASHEM's Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians, and spared our houses.'"
The people bowed their heads and worshiped. 
verse:12:28 The children of Israel went and did so; as HASHEM had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.
portion:Exodus 12:29 - 12:51
verse:12:29 It happened at midnight, that HASHEM struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of livestock. 
verse:12:30 Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead. 
verse:12:31 He called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, "Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve HASHEM, as you have said! 
verse:12:32 Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also!"
verse:12:33 The Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, "We are all dead men." 
verse:12:34 The people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders. 
verse:12:35 The children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing. 
verse:12:36 HASHEM gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. They despoiled the Egyptians.
verse:12:37 The children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, besides children. 
verse:12:38 A mixed multitude went up also with them, with flocks, herds, and even very much livestock. 
verse:12:39 They baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt; for it wasn't leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn't wait, neither had they prepared for themselves any food. 
verse:12:40 Now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years. 
verse:12:41 It happened at the end of four hundred thirty years, even the same day it happened, that all the armies of HASHEM went out from the land of Egypt. 
verse:12:42 It is a night to be much observed to HASHEM for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of HASHEM, to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations.
verse:12:43 HASHEM said to Moses and Aaron, "This is the ordinance of the Passover. No foreigner shall eat of it, 
verse:12:44 but every man's servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat of it. 
verse:12:45 A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it. 
verse:12:46 In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry out anything of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall you break a bone of it. 
verse:12:47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. 
verse:12:48 When a stranger shall live as a foreigner with you, and will keep the Passover to HASHEM, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one who is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat of it. 
verse:12:49 One law shall be to him who is born at home, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you." 
verse:12:50 All the children of Israel did so. As HASHEM commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did. 
verse:12:51 It happened the same day, that HASHEM brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
portion:Exodus 13:1 - 13:16
verse:13:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:13:2 "Sanctify to me all of the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of animal. It is mine."
verse:13:3 Moses said to the people, "Remember this day, in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand HASHEM brought you out from this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten. 
verse:13:4 This day you go out in the month Abib. 
verse:13:5 It shall be, when HASHEM shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month. 
verse:13:6 Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to HASHEM. 
verse:13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and no leavened bread shall be seen with you, neither shall yeast be seen with you, in all your borders. 
verse:13:8 You shall tell your son in that day, saying, 'It is because of that which HASHEM did for me when I came out of Egypt.' 
verse:13:9 It shall be for a sign to you on your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that the law of HASHEM may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand HASHEM has brought you out of Egypt. 
verse:13:10 You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
verse:13:11 "It shall be, when HASHEM shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and shall give it you, 
verse:13:12 that you shall set apart to HASHEM all that opens the womb, and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal. The males shall be HASHEM's. 
verse:13:13 Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons. 
verse:13:14 It shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, 'What is this?' that you shall tell him, 'By strength of hand HASHEM brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage; 
verse:13:15 and it happened, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that HASHEM killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of animal. Therefore I sacrifice to HASHEM all that opens the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.' 
verse:13:16 It shall be for a sign on your hand, and for symbols between your eyes: for by strength of hand HASHEM brought us out of Egypt."
portion:Exodus 13:14 - 13:16
verse:13:14 It shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, 'What is this?' that you shall tell him, 'By strength of hand HASHEM brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage; 
verse:13:15 and it happened, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that HASHEM killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of animal. Therefore I sacrifice to HASHEM all that opens the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.' 
verse:13:16 It shall be for a sign on your hand, and for symbols between your eyes: for by strength of hand HASHEM brought us out of Egypt."
portion:Exodus 13:17 - 14:8
verse:13:17 It happened, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God didn't lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, "Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and they return to Egypt;" 
verse:13:18 but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Sea of Suf; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt. 
verse:13:19 Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the children of Israel swear, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you." 
verse:13:20 They took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. 
verse:13:21 HASHEM went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them on their way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night: 
verse:13:22 the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, didn't depart from before the people.
verse:14:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:14:2 "Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal Zephon. You shall encamp opposite it by the sea. 
verse:14:3 Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, 'They are entangled in the land. The wilderness has shut them in.' 
verse:14:4 I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will follow after them; and I will get honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies; and the Egyptians shall know that I am HASHEM." They did so.
verse:14:5 It was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, "What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?" 
verse:14:6 He prepared his chariot, and took his army with him; 
verse:14:7 and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them. 
verse:14:8 HASHEM hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand.
portion:Exodus 14:9 - 14:14
verse:14:9 The Egyptians pursued after them: all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his army; and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal Zephon.
verse:14:10 When Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were very afraid. The children of Israel cried out to HASHEM. 
verse:14:11 They said to Moses, "Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you treated us this way, to bring us out of Egypt? 
verse:14:12 Isn't this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, 'Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?' For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness."
verse:14:13 Moses said to the people, "Don't be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of HASHEM, which he will work for you today: for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you shall never see them again. 
verse:14:14 HASHEM will fight for you, and you shall be still."
portion:Exodus 14:15 - 14:25
verse:14:15 HASHEM said to Moses, "Why do you cry to me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward. 
verse:14:16 Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground. 
verse:14:17 I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them: and I will get myself honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies, over his chariots, and over his horsemen. 
verse:14:18 The Egyptians shall know that I am HASHEM, when I have gotten myself honor over Pharaoh, over his chariots, and over his horsemen." 
verse:14:19 The angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them, and stood behind them. 
verse:14:20 It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and the one didn't come near the other all the night.
verse:14:21 Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and HASHEM caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. 
verse:14:22 The children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left. 
verse:14:23 The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea: all of Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. 
verse:14:24 It happened in the morning watch, that HASHEM looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and confused the Egyptian army. 
verse:14:25 He took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, "Let's flee from the face of Israel, for HASHEM fights for them against the Egyptians!"
portion:Exodus 14:26 - 15:26
verse:14:26 HASHEM said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen." 
verse:14:27 Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it. HASHEM overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. 
verse:14:28 The waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even all Pharaoh's army that went in after them into the sea. There remained not so much as one of them. 
verse:14:29 But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left. 
verse:14:30 Thus HASHEM saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. 
verse:14:31 Israel saw the great work which HASHEM did to the Egyptians, and the people feared HASHEM; and they believed in HASHEM, and in his servant Moses.
verse:15:1 Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to HASHEM, and said, "I will sing to HASHEM, for he has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea. 
verse:15:2 HASHEM is my strength and song. He has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will praise him; my father's God, and I will exalt him. 
verse:15:3 HASHEM is a man of war. HASHEM is his name. 
verse:15:4 He has cast Pharaoh's chariots and his army into the sea. His chosen captains are sunk in the Sea of Suf. 
verse:15:5 The deeps cover them. They went down into the depths like a stone. 
verse:15:6 Your right hand, HASHEM, is glorious in power. Your right hand, HASHEM, dashes the enemy in pieces. 
verse:15:7 In the greatness of your excellency, you overthrow those who  rise up against you. You send forth your wrath. It consumes them as stubble. 
verse:15:8 With the blast of your nostrils, the waters were piled up. The floods stood upright as a heap. The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea. 
verse:15:9 The enemy said, 'I will pursue. I will overtake. I will divide  the spoil. My desire shall be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.' 
verse:15:10 You blew with your wind. The sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters. 
verse:15:11 Who is like you, HASHEM, among the gods? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? 
verse:15:12 You stretched out your right hand. The earth swallowed them.  
verse:15:13 "You, in your loving kindness, have led the people that you  have redeemed. You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation. 
verse:15:14 The peoples have heard. They tremble. Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia. 
verse:15:15 Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed. Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab. All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away. 
verse:15:16 Terror and dread falls on them. By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone-- until your people pass over, HASHEM, until the people pass over who you have purchased. 
verse:15:17 You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of  your inheritance, the place, HASHEM, which you have made for yourself to dwell in; the sanctuary, my Lord, which your hands have established. 
verse:15:18 HASHEM shall reign forever and ever."
verse:15:19 For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and HASHEM brought back the waters of the sea on them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea. 
verse:15:20 Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances. 
verse:15:21 Miriam answered them, "Sing to HASHEM, for he has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea."
verse:15:22 Moses led Israel onward from the Sea of Suf, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. 
verse:15:23 When they came to Marah, they couldn't drink from the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore its name was called Marah. 
verse:15:24 The people murmured against Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?" 
verse:15:25 Then he cried to HASHEM. HASHEM showed him a tree, and he threw it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there he tested them; 
verse:15:26 and he said, "If you will diligently listen to the voice of HASHEM your God, and will do that which is right in his eyes, and will pay attention to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you, which I have put on the Egyptians; for I am HASHEM who heals you."
portion:Exodus 15:27 - 16:10
verse:15:27 They came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.
verse:16:1 They took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. 
verse:16:2 The whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness; 
verse:16:3 and the children of Israel said to them, "We wish that we had died by the hand of HASHEM in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the meat pots, when we ate our fill of bread, for you have brought us out into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger."
verse:16:4 Then HASHEM said to Moses, "Behold, I will rain bread from the sky for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law, or not. 
verse:16:5 It shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily."
verse:16:6 Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, "At evening, then you shall know that HASHEM has brought you out from the land of Egypt; 
verse:16:7 and in the morning, then you shall see the glory of HASHEM; because he hears your murmurings against HASHEM. Who are we, that you murmur against us?" 
verse:16:8 Moses said, "Now HASHEM shall give you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to satisfy you; because HASHEM hears your murmurings which you murmur against him. And who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against HASHEM." 
verse:16:9 Moses said to Aaron, "Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel, 'Come near before HASHEM, for he has heard your murmurings.'" 
verse:16:10 It happened, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of HASHEM appeared in the cloud.
portion:Exodus 16:11 - 16:36
verse:16:11 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:16:12 "I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, 'At evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread: and you shall know that I am HASHEM your God.'"
verse:16:13 It happened at evening that quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp. 
verse:16:14 When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the frost on the ground. 
verse:16:15 When the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, "What is it?" For they didn't know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread which HASHEM has given you to eat." 
verse:16:16 This is the thing which HASHEM has commanded: "Gather of it everyone according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, you shall take it, every man for those who are in his tent." 
verse:16:17 The children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less. 
verse:16:18 When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They gathered every man according to his eating. 
verse:16:19 Moses said to them, "Let no one leave of it until the morning." 
verse:16:20 Notwithstanding they didn't listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was angry with them. 
verse:16:21 They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted. 
verse:16:22 It happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one, and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. 
verse:16:23 He said to them, "This is that which HASHEM has spoken, 'Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to HASHEM. Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.'" 
verse:16:24 They laid it up until the morning, as Moses asked, and it didn't become foul, neither was there any worm in it. 
verse:16:25 Moses said, "Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to HASHEM. Today you shall not find it in the field. 
verse:16:26 Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be none." 
verse:16:27 It happened on the seventh day, that some of the people went out to gather, and they found none. 
verse:16:28 HASHEM said to Moses, "How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws? 
verse:16:29 Behold, because HASHEM has given you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Everyone stay in his place. Let no one go out of his place on the seventh day." 
verse:16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.
verse:16:31 The house of Israel called its name Manna, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey. 
verse:16:32 Moses said, "This is the thing which HASHEM has commanded, 'Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.'" 
verse:16:33 Moses said to Aaron, "Take a pot, and put an omer-full of manna in it, and lay it up before HASHEM, to be kept throughout your generations." 
verse:16:34 As HASHEM commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. 
verse:16:35 The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan. 
verse:16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an efah.
portion:Exodus 17:1 - 17:16
verse:17:1 All the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to HASHEM's commandment, and encamped in Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink. 
verse:17:2 Therefore the people quarreled with Moses, and said, "Give us water to drink."
Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test HASHEM?"
verse:17:3 The people were thirsty for water there; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?"
verse:17:4 Moses cried to HASHEM, saying, "What shall I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me."
verse:17:5 HASHEM said to Moses, "Walk on before the people, and take the elders of Israel with you, and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile, and go. 
verse:17:6 Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb. You shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink." Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
verse:17:7 He called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because the children of Israel quarreled, and because they tested HASHEM, saying, "Is HASHEM among us, or not?"
verse:17:8 Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 
verse:17:9 Moses said to Joshua, "Choose men for us, and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God's rod in my hand." 
verse:17:10 So Joshua did as Moses had told him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
verse:17:11 It happened, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. 
verse:17:12 But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. His hands were steady until sunset. 
verse:17:13 Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 
verse:17:14 HASHEM said to Moses, "Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky." 
verse:17:15 Moses built an altar, and called its name HASHEM our Banner. 
verse:17:16 He said, "HASHEM has sworn: 'HASHEM will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.'"
portion:Exodus 17:14 - 17:16
verse:17:14 HASHEM said to Moses, "Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky." 
verse:17:15 Moses built an altar, and called its name HASHEM our Banner. 
verse:17:16 He said, "HASHEM has sworn: 'HASHEM will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.'"
portion:Exodus 18:1 - 18:12
verse:18:1 Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that HASHEM had brought Israel out of Egypt. 
verse:18:2 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, received Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away, 
verse:18:3 and her two sons. The name of one son was Gershom, for Moses said, "I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land". 
verse:18:4 The name of the other was Eliezer, for he said, "My father's God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh's sword." 
verse:18:5 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the Mountain of God. 
verse:18:6 He said to Moses, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, have come to you with your wife, and her two sons with her."
verse:18:7 Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed and kissed him. They asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent. 
verse:18:8 Moses told his father-in-law all that HASHEM had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardships that had come on them on the way, and how HASHEM delivered them. 
verse:18:9 Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which HASHEM had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians. 
verse:18:10 Jethro said, "Blessed be HASHEM, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. 
verse:18:11 Now I know that HASHEM is greater than all gods because of the thing in which they dealt arrogantly against them." 
verse:18:12 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. Aaron came with all of the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.

verse:18:13 It happened on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening. 
verse:18:14 When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, "What is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?"
verse:18:15 Moses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to inquire of God. 
verse:18:16 When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws." 
verse:18:17 Moses' father-in-law said to him, "The thing that you do is not good. 
verse:18:18 You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to perform it yourself alone. 
verse:18:19 Listen now to my voice. I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You represent the people before God, and bring the causes to God. 
verse:18:20 You shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do. 
verse:18:21 Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God: men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
verse:18:22 Let them judge the people at all times. It shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge themselves. So shall it be easier for you, and they shall share the load with you. 
verse:18:23 If you will do this thing, and God commands you so, then you will be able to endure, and all of these people also will go to their place in peace."
portion:Exodus 18:24 - 18:27
verse:18:24 So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said. 
verse:18:25 Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
verse:18:26 They judged the people at all times. They brought the hard causes to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. 
verse:18:27 Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into his own land.

verse:19:1 In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. 
verse:19:2 When they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mountain. 
verse:19:3 Moses went up to God, and HASHEM called to him out of the mountain, saying, "This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: 
verse:19:4 'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself. 
verse:19:5 Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice, and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples; for all the earth is mine; 
verse:19:6 and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.' These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel."

verse:19:7 Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which HASHEM commanded him. 
verse:19:8 All the people answered together, and said, "All that HASHEM has spoken we will do."
Moses reported the words of the people to HASHEM. 
verse:19:9 HASHEM said to Moses, "Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever." Moses told the words of the people to HASHEM. 
verse:19:10 HASHEM said to Moses, "Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments, 
verse:19:11 and be ready against the third day; for on the third day HASHEM will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai. 
verse:19:12 You shall set bounds to the people all around, saying, 'Be careful that you don't go up onto the mountain, or touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death. 
verse:19:13 No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.' When the shofar sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain."
verse:19:14 Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. 
verse:19:15 He said to the people, "Be ready by the third day. Don't have sexual relations with a woman."
verse:19:16 It happened on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud shofar; and all the people who were in the camp trembled. 
verse:19:17 Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain. 
verse:19:18 Mount Sinai, all it, smoked, because HASHEM descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly. 
verse:19:19 When the sound of the shofar grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.
portion:Exodus 19:20 - 20:14
verse:19:20 HASHEM came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. HASHEM called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
verse:19:21 HASHEM said to Moses, "Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to HASHEM to gaze, and many of them perish. 
verse:19:22 Let the priests also, who come near to HASHEM, sanctify themselves, lest HASHEM break forth on them."
verse:19:23 Moses said to HASHEM, "The people can't come up to Mount Sinai, for you warned us, saying, 'Set bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.'"
verse:19:24 HASHEM said to him, "Go down and you shall bring Aaron up with you, but don't let the priests and the people break through to come up to HASHEM, lest he break forth on them."
verse:19:25 So Moses went down to the people, and told them.
verse:20:1 God spoke all these words, saying, 
verse:20:2 "I am HASHEM your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
verse:20:3 "You shall have no other gods before me.
verse:20:4 "You shall not make for yourselves an idol, nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: 
verse:20:5 you shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them, for I, HASHEM your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me, 
verse:20:6 and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
verse:20:7 "You shall not take the name of HASHEM your God in vain, for HASHEM will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.
verse:20:8 "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 
verse:20:9 You shall labor six days, and do all your work, 
verse:20:10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to HASHEM your God. You shall not do any work in it, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates; 
verse:20:11 for in six days HASHEM made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore HASHEM blessed the Sabbath day, and made it holy.
verse:20:12 "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which HASHEM your God gives you.
verse:20:13 "You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.

portion:Exodus 20:15 - 20:23
verse:20:15 All the people perceived the thunderings, the lightnings, the sound of the shofar, and the mountain smoking. When the people saw it, they trembled, and stayed at a distance. 
verse:20:16 They said to Moses, "Speak with us yourself, and we will listen; but don't let God speak with us, lest we die."
verse:20:17 Moses said to the people, "Don't be afraid, for God has come to test you, and that his fear may be before you, that you won't sin." 
verse:20:18 The people stayed at a distance, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.
verse:20:19 HASHEM said to Moses, "This is what you shall tell the children of Israel: 'You yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. 
verse:20:20 You shall most certainly not make alongside of me gods of silver, or gods of gold for yourselves. 
verse:20:21 You shall make an altar of earth for me, and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I record my name I will come to you and I will bless you. 
verse:20:22 If you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of cut stones; for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it. 
verse:20:23 Neither shall you go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed to it.'

verse:30:11 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:30:12 "When you take a census of the children of Israel, according to those who are numbered among them, then each man shall give a ransom for his soul to HASHEM, when you number them; that there be no plague among them when you number them. 
verse:30:13 They shall give this, everyone who passes over to those who are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary; (the shekel is twenty gerahs;) half a shekel for an offering to HASHEM. 
verse:30:14 Everyone who passes over to those who are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering to HASHEM. 
verse:30:15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of HASHEM, to make atonement for your souls. 
verse:30:16 You shall take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shall appoint it for the service of the Tent of Meeting; that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before HASHEM, to make atonement for your souls."
verse:30:17 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:30:18 "You shall also make a basin of brass, and its base of brass, in which to wash. You shall put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it. 
verse:30:19 Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet in it. 
verse:30:20 When they go into the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water, that they not die; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire to HASHEM. 
verse:30:21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they not die: and it shall be a statute forever to them, even to him and to his descendants throughout their generations."
verse:30:22 Moreover HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:30:23 "Also take fine spices: of liquid myrrh, five hundred shekels; and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, even two hundred and fifty; and of fragrant cane, two hundred and fifty; 
verse:30:24 and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary; and a hin of olive oil. 
verse:30:25 You shall make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer: it shall be a holy anointing oil. 
verse:30:26 You shall use it to anoint the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the testimony, 
verse:30:27 the table and all its articles, the menorah and its accessories, the altar of incense, 
verse:30:28 the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin with its base. 
verse:30:29 You shall sanctify them, that they may be most holy. Whatever touches them shall be holy. 
verse:30:30 You shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priest's office. 
verse:30:31 You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'This shall be a holy anointing oil to me throughout your generations. 
verse:30:32 It shall not be poured on man's flesh, neither shall you make any like it, according to its composition: it is holy. It shall be holy to you. 
verse:30:33 Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it on a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.'"
verse:30:34 HASHEM said to Moses, "Take to yourself sweet spices, gum resin, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense: there shall be an equal weight of each; 
verse:30:35 and you shall make incense of it, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy: 
verse:30:36 and you shall beat some of it very small, and put some of it before the testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be to you most holy. 
verse:30:37 The incense which you shall make, according to its composition you shall not make for yourselves: it shall be to you holy for HASHEM. 
verse:30:38 Whoever shall make any like that, to smell of it, he shall be cut off from his people."
verse:31:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:31:2 "Behold, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: 
verse:31:3 and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship, 
verse:31:4 to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 
verse:31:5 and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of workmanship. 
verse:31:6 I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you: 
verse:31:7 the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the testimony, the mercy seat that is on it, all the furniture of the Tent, 
verse:31:8 the table and its vessels, the pure menorah with all its vessels, the altar of incense, 
verse:31:9 the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, the basin and its base, 
verse:31:10 the finely worked garments--the holy garments for Aaron the priest--the garments of his sons to minister in the priest's office, 
verse:31:11 the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded you they shall do."
verse:31:12 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:31:13 "Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, 'Most certainly you shall keep my Sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am HASHEM who sanctifies you. 
verse:31:14 You shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
verse:31:15 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to HASHEM. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death. 
verse:31:16 Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 
verse:31:17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days HASHEM made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.'"
portion:Exodus 31:18 - 33:11
verse:31:18 He gave to Moses, when he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets, written with God's finger.
verse:32:1 When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, "Come, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him."
verse:32:2 Aaron said to them, "Take off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me."
verse:32:3 All the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron. 
verse:32:4 He received what they handed him, and fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it a molten calf; and they said, "These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt."
verse:32:5 When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, "Tomorrow shall be a feast to HASHEM."
verse:32:6 They rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
verse:32:7 HASHEM spoke to Moses, "Go, get down; for your people, who you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves! 
verse:32:8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, 'These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.'"
verse:32:9 HASHEM said to Moses, "I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people. 
verse:32:10 Now therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation."
verse:32:11 Moses begged HASHEM his God, and said, "HASHEM, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? 
verse:32:12 Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, 'He brought them forth for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?' Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people. 
verse:32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, 'I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your seed, and they shall inherit it forever.'"
verse:32:14 HASHEM repented of the evil which he said he would do to his people.
verse:32:15 Moses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand; tablets that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other they were written. 
verse:32:16 The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tables.
verse:32:17 When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "There is the noise of war in the camp."
verse:32:18 He said, "It isn't the voice of those who shout for victory, neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I hear." 
verse:32:19 It happened, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing: and Moses' anger grew hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mountain. 
verse:32:20 He took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.
verse:32:21 Moses said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?"
verse:32:22 Aaron said, "Don't let the anger of my lord grow hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil. 
verse:32:23 For they said to me, 'Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him.' 
verse:32:24 I said to them, 'Whoever has any gold, let them take it off:' so they gave it to me; and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."
verse:32:25 When Moses saw that the people had broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies), 
verse:32:26 then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, "Whoever is on HASHEM's side, come to me!"
All the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him. 
verse:32:27 He said to them, "Thus says HASHEM, the God of Israel, 'Every man put his sword on his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.'" 
verse:32:28 The sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 
verse:32:29 Moses said, "Consecrate yourselves today to HASHEM, yes, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow on you a blessing this day."
verse:32:30 It happened on the next day, that Moses said to the people, "You have sinned a great sin. Now I will go up to HASHEM. Perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin."
verse:32:31 Moses returned to HASHEM, and said, "Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves gods of gold. 
verse:32:32 Yet now, if you will, forgive their sin--and if not, please blot me out of your book which you have written."
verse:32:33 HASHEM said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. 
verse:32:34 Now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you. Behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin." 
verse:32:35 HASHEM struck the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.
verse:33:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, "Depart, go up from here, you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your seed.' 
verse:33:2 I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 
verse:33:3 to a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of you, for you are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume you in the way."
verse:33:4 When the people heard this evil news, they mourned: and no one put on his jewelry.
verse:33:5 HASHEM said to Moses, "Tell the children of Israel, 'You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go up into your midst for one moment, I would consume you. Therefore now take off your jewelry from you, that I may know what to do to you.'"
verse:33:6 The children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward.
verse:33:7 Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and he called it "The Tent of Meeting." It happened that everyone who sought HASHEM went out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp. 
verse:33:8 It happened that when Moses went out to the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, everyone at their tent door, and watched Moses, until he had gone into the Tent. 
verse:33:9 It happened, when Moses entered into the Tent, that the pillar of cloud descended, stood at the door of the Tent, and spoke with Moses. 
verse:33:10 All the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent, and all the people rose up and worshiped, everyone at their tent door. 
verse:33:11 HASHEM spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. He turned again into the camp, but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, didn't depart out of the Tent.

verse:33:12 Moses said to HASHEM, "Behold, you tell me, 'Bring up this people:' and you haven't let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.' 
verse:33:13 Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you, so that I may find favor in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people."
verse:33:14 He said, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."
verse:33:15 He said to him, "If your presence doesn't go with me, don't carry us up from here. 
verse:33:16 For how would people know that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Isn't it in that you go with us, so that we are separated, I and your people, from all the people who are on the surface of the earth?"

verse:33:20 He said, "You cannot see my face, for man may not see me and live." 
verse:33:21 HASHEM also said, "Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand on the rock. 
verse:33:22 It will happen, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by; 
verse:33:23 then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back; but my face shall not be seen."

verse:34:2 Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain. 
verse:34:3 No one shall come up with you; neither let anyone be seen throughout all the mountain; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mountain."
verse:34:4 He chiseled two tablets of stone like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai, as HASHEM had commanded him, and took in his hand two stone tablets. 
verse:34:5 HASHEM descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of HASHEM. 
verse:34:6 HASHEM passed by before him, and proclaimed, "HASHEM! HASHEM, a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth, 
verse:34:7 keeping loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children's children, on the third and on the fourth generation."
verse:34:8 Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped. 
verse:34:9 He said, "If now I have found favor in your sight, my Lord, please let my Lord go in the midst of us; although this is a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance."

verse:34:10 He said, "Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been worked in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which you are shall see the work of HASHEM; for it is an awesome thing that I do with you. 
verse:34:11 Observe that which I command you this day. Behold, I drive out before you the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
verse:34:12 Be careful, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be for a snare in the midst of you: 
verse:34:13 but you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and you shall cut down their Asherim; 
verse:34:14 for you shall worship no other god: for HASHEM, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
verse:34:15 "Don't make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, lest they play the prostitute after their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice;

verse:34:29 It happened, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mountain, that Moses didn't know that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him. 
verse:34:30 When Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him. 
verse:34:31 Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke to them.

verse:9:2 and he said to Aaron, "Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before HASHEM. 
verse:9:3 You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 
verse:9:4 and a bull and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before HASHEM; and a meal offering mixed with oil: for today HASHEM appears to you.'"
verse:9:5 They brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before HASHEM. 
verse:9:6 Moses said, "This is the thing which HASHEM commanded that you should do: and the glory of HASHEM shall appear to you." 
verse:9:7 Moses said to Aaron, "Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as HASHEM commanded."
verse:9:8 So Aaron drew near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. 
verse:9:9 The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar: 
verse:9:10 but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the sin offering, he burned upon the altar; as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:9:11 The flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp. 
verse:9:12 He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons delivered the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar. 
verse:9:13 They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burned them upon the altar. 
verse:9:14 He washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar. 
verse:9:15 He presented the people's offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, like the first. 
verse:9:16 He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.

verse:9:17 He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and burned it upon the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning. 
verse:9:18 He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar, 
verse:9:19 and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver: 
verse:9:20 and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar: 
verse:9:21 and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before HASHEM, as Moses commanded. 
verse:9:22 Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.
verse:9:23 Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of HASHEM appeared to all the people.
portion:Leviticus 9:24 - 10:11
verse:9:24 There came forth fire from before HASHEM, and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
verse:10:1 Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and offered strange fire before HASHEM, which he had not commanded them. 
verse:10:2 And fire came forth from before HASHEM, and devoured them, and they died before HASHEM.
verse:10:3 Then Moses said to Aaron, "This is what HASHEM spoke of, saying, 'I will show myself holy to those who come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified.'"
Aaron held his peace. 
verse:10:4 Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, "Draw near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp." 
verse:10:5 So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
verse:10:6 Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, "Don't let the hair of your heads go loose, neither tear your clothes; that you don't die, and that he not be angry with all the congregation: but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which HASHEM has kindled. 
verse:10:7 You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of HASHEM is on you." They did according to the word of Moses.
verse:10:8 HASHEM spoke to Aaron, saying, 
verse:10:9 "Drink no wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the Tent of Meeting, that you don't die: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations: 
verse:10:10 and that you are to make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean; 
verse:10:11 and that you are to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which HASHEM has spoken to them by Moses."

verse:10:12 Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, "Take the meal offering that remains of the offerings of HASHEM made by fire, and eat it without yeast beside the altar; for it is most holy; 
verse:10:13 and you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion, and your sons' portion, of the offerings of HASHEM made by fire: for so I am commanded. 
verse:10:14 The waved breast and the heaved thigh you shall eat in a clean place, you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they are given as your portion, and your sons' portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel. 
verse:10:15 The heaved thigh and the waved breast they shall bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before HASHEM: and it shall be yours, and your sons' with you, as a portion forever; as HASHEM has commanded."
portion:Leviticus 10:16 - 10:20
verse:10:16 Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burned: and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying, 
verse:10:17 "Why haven't you eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since it is most holy, and he has given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before HASHEM? 
verse:10:18 Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary: you certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded."
verse:10:19 Aaron spoke to Moses, "Behold, this day they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before HASHEM; and such things as these have happened to me: and if I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been pleasing in the sight of HASHEM?"
verse:10:20 When Moses heard that, it was pleasing in his sight.

verse:8:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying,

verse:8:6 "Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.

verse:8:17 For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine, both man and animal. On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for myself. 
verse:8:18 I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel. 
verse:8:19 I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the Tent of Meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come near to the sanctuary."

verse:8:25 and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting on the work, and shall serve no more, 
verse:8:26 but shall minister with their brothers in the Tent of Meeting, to perform the duty, and shall do no service. You shall do thus to the Levites concerning their duties."

verse:9:6 There were certain men, who were unclean because of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day. 
verse:9:7 Those men said to him, "We are unclean because of the dead body of a man. Why are we kept back, that we may not offer the offering of HASHEM in its appointed season among the children of Israel?"
verse:9:8 Moses answered them, "Wait, that I may hear what HASHEM will command concerning you."
verse:9:9 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:9:10 "Say to the children of Israel, 'If any man of you or of your generations is unclean by reason of a dead body, or is on a journey far away, he shall still keep the Passover to HASHEM. 
verse:9:11 In the second month, on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 
verse:9:12 They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it. According to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it. 
verse:9:13 But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails to keep the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people. Because he didn't offer the offering of HASHEM in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
verse:9:14 "'If a foreigner lives among you, and desires to keep the Passover to HASHEM; according to the statute of the Passover, and according to its ordinance, so shall he do. You shall have one statute, both for the foreigner, and for him who is born in the land.'"

verse:9:18 At the commandment of HASHEM, the children of Israel traveled, and at the commandment of HASHEM they encamped. As long as the cloud remained on the tabernacle they remained encamped.

verse:10:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:10:2 "Make two shofars of silver. You shall make them of beaten work. You shall use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps. 
verse:10:3 When they blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:10:4 If they blow just one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to you. 
verse:10:5 When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall go forward.

verse:10:9 When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the shofars. Then you will be remembered before HASHEM your God, and you will be saved from your enemies.
verse:10:10 "Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the shofars over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God. I am HASHEM your God."

verse:10:30 He said to him, "I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my relatives."
verse:10:31 He said, "Don't leave us, please; because you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes.

verse:11:1 The people were complaining in the ears of HASHEM. When HASHEM heard it, his anger was kindled; and HASHEM's fire burnt among them, and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp. 
verse:11:2 The people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to HASHEM, and the fire abated. 
verse:11:3 The name of that place was called Taberah, because HASHEM's fire burnt among them.
verse:11:4 The mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, "Who will give us flesh to eat? 
verse:11:5 We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic; 
verse:11:6 but now we have lost our appetite. There is nothing at all except this manna to look at." 
verse:11:7 The manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium. 
verse:11:8 The people went around, gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it. Its taste was like the taste of fresh oil. 
verse:11:9 When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.
verse:11:10 Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and the anger of HASHEM was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased. 
verse:11:11 Moses said to HASHEM, "Why have you treated with your servant so badly? Why haven't I found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me? 
verse:11:12 Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them forth, that you should tell me, 'Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you swore to their fathers?' 
verse:11:13 Where could I get meat to give to all this people? For they weep to me, saying, 'Give us meat, that we may eat.' 
verse:11:14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me. 
verse:11:15 If you treat me this way, please kill me right now, if I have found favor in your sight; and don't let me see my wretchedness."
verse:11:16 HASHEM said to Moses, "Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you. 
verse:11:17 I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you not bear it yourself alone.
verse:11:18 "Say to the people, 'Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and you will eat flesh; for you have wept in the ears of HASHEM, saying, "Who will give us flesh to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt." Therefore HASHEM will give you flesh, and you will eat. 
verse:11:19 You will not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days, 
verse:11:20 but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it is loathsome to you; because that you have rejected HASHEM who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, "Why did we come out of Egypt?"'"
verse:11:21 Moses said, "The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand men on foot; and you have said, 'I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.' 
verse:11:22 Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?"
verse:11:23 HASHEM said to Moses, "Has HASHEM's hand grown short? Now you will see whether my word will happen to you or not."
verse:11:24 Moses went out, and told the people the words of HASHEM; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the Tent. 
verse:11:25 HASHEM came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders: and it happened that when the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did so no more. 
verse:11:26 But two men remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested on them; and they were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp. 
verse:11:27 A young man ran, and told Moses, and said, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!"
verse:11:28 Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered, "My lord Moses, forbid them!"

verse:11:30 Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. 
verse:11:31 A wind from HASHEM went out and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the earth. 
verse:11:32 The people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten omers; and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp. 
verse:11:33 While the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of HASHEM was kindled against the people, and HASHEM struck the people with a very great plague. 
verse:11:34 The name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.
verse:11:35 From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth; and they stayed at Hazeroth.
verse:12:1 Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman. 
verse:12:2 They said, "Has HASHEM indeed spoken only with Moses? Hasn't he spoken also with us?" And HASHEM heard it.
verse:12:3 Now the man Moses was very humble, above all the men who were on the surface of the earth. 
verse:12:4 HASHEM spoke suddenly to Moses, to Aaron, and to Miriam, "You three come out to the Tent of Meeting!"
The three of them came out. 
verse:12:5 HASHEM came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward. 
verse:12:6 He said, "Hear now my words. If there is a prophet among you, I HASHEM will make myself known to him in a vision. I will speak with him in a dream. 
verse:12:7 My servant Moses is not so. He is faithful in all my house. 
verse:12:8 With him I will speak mouth to mouth, even plainly, and not in riddles; and he shall see HASHEM's form. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?" 
verse:12:9 The anger of HASHEM was kindled against them; and he departed. 
verse:12:10 The cloud departed from over the Tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. Aaron looked at Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.
verse:12:11 Aaron said to Moses, "Oh, my lord, please don't count this sin against us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned. 
verse:12:12 Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb."
verse:12:13 Moses cried to HASHEM, saying, "Heal her, God, I beg you!"

verse:13:18 and see the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many; 
verse:13:19 and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds; 
verse:13:20 and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. Be courageous, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes."
portion:Numbers 13:21 - 14:7
verse:13:21 So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath. 
verse:13:22 They went up by the South, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
verse:13:23 They came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it on a staff between two. They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs. 
verse:13:24 That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there. 
verse:13:25 They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days. 
verse:13:26 They went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. 
verse:13:27 They told him, and said, "We came to the land where you sent us; and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this is its fruit. 
verse:13:28 However the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw the children of Anak there. 
verse:13:29 Amalek dwells in the land of the South: and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill country; and the Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan." 
verse:13:30 Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, "Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it." 
verse:13:31 But the men who went up with him said, "We aren't able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we." 
verse:13:32 They brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the children of Israel, saying, "The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw in it are men of great stature. 
verse:13:33 There we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight."
verse:14:1 All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. 
verse:14:2 All the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said to them, "Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would that we had died in this wilderness! 
verse:14:3 Why does HASHEM bring us to this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be a prey: wouldn't it be better for us to return into Egypt?" 
verse:14:4 They said one to another, "Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt." 
verse:14:5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. 
verse:14:6 Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes: 
verse:14:7 and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, "The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land.
portion:Numbers 14:8 - 14:25
verse:14:8 If HASHEM delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which flows with milk and honey. 
verse:14:9 Only don't rebel against HASHEM, neither fear the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is removed from over them, and HASHEM is with us. Don't fear them." 
verse:14:10 But all the congregation threatened to stone them with stones. The glory of HASHEM appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel. 
verse:14:11 HASHEM said to Moses, "How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have worked among them? 
verse:14:12 I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they." 
verse:14:13 Moses said to HASHEM, "Then the Egyptians will hear it; for you brought up this people in your might from among them; 
verse:14:14 and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you HASHEM are in the midst of this people; for you HASHEM are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night. 
verse:14:15 Now if you killed this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying, 
verse:14:16 'Because HASHEM was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.' 
verse:14:17 Now please let the power of my Lord be great, according as you have spoken, saying, 
verse:14:18 'HASHEM is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, forgiving iniquity and disobedience; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation.' 
verse:14:19 Please pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving kindness, and according as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now." 
verse:14:20 HASHEM said, "I have pardoned according to your word: 
verse:14:21 but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of HASHEM; 
verse:14:22 because all those men who have seen my glory, and my signs, which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not listened to my voice; 
verse:14:23 surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of those who despised me see it: 
verse:14:24 but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land into which he went; and his seed shall possess it. 
verse:14:25 Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley: tomorrow turn, and go into the wilderness by the way to the Sea of Suf."
portion:Numbers 14:26 - 15:7
verse:14:26 HASHEM spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
verse:14:27 "How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, that murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me. 
verse:14:28 Tell them, 'As I live, says HASHEM, surely as you have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you: 
verse:14:29 your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all who were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me, 
verse:14:30 surely you shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. 
verse:14:31 But your little ones, that you said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which you have rejected. 
verse:14:32 But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness. 
verse:14:33 Your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your prostitution, until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness. 
verse:14:34 After the number of the days in which you spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, you will bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you will know my alienation.' 
verse:14:35 I, HASHEM, have spoken, surely this will I do to all this evil congregation, who are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die." 
verse:14:36 The men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land, 
verse:14:37 even those men who brought up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before HASHEM. 
verse:14:38 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land. 
verse:14:39 Moses told these words to all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly. 
verse:14:40 They rose up early in the morning, and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, "Behold, we are here, and will go up to the place which HASHEM has promised: for we have sinned." 
verse:14:41 Moses said, "Why now do you disobey the commandment of HASHEM, since it shall not prosper? 
verse:14:42 Don't go up, for HASHEM isn't among you; that you not be struck down before your enemies. 
verse:14:43 For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and you shall fall by the sword: because you are turned back from following HASHEM, therefore HASHEM will not be with you."
verse:14:44 But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of HASHEM, and Moses, didn't depart out of the camp. 
verse:14:45 Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite who lived in that mountain, and struck them and beat them down, even to Hormah.
verse:15:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:15:2 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you have come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you, 
verse:15:3 and will make an offering by fire to HASHEM, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a freewill offering, or in your set feasts, to make a pleasant aroma to HASHEM, of the herd, or of the flock; 
verse:15:4 then he who offers his offering shall offer to HASHEM a meal offering of a tenth part of an efah of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of oil: 
verse:15:5 and wine for the drink offering, the fourth part of a hin, you shall prepare with the burnt offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.
verse:15:6 "'Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenth parts of an efah of fine flour mixed with the third part of a hin of oil: 
verse:15:7 and for the drink offering you shall offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a pleasant aroma to HASHEM.
portion:Numbers 15:8 - 15:16
verse:15:8 When you prepare a bull for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings to HASHEM; 
verse:15:9 then shall he offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenth parts of an efah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil: 
verse:15:10 and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to HASHEM. 
verse:15:11 Thus shall it be done for each bull, or for each ram, or for each of the male lambs, or of the young goats. 
verse:15:12 According to the number that you shall prepare, so you shall do to everyone according to their number.
verse:15:13 "'All who are native-born shall do these things in this way, in offering an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to HASHEM. 
verse:15:14 If a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, or whoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to HASHEM; as you do, so he shall do. 
verse:15:15 For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner, a statute forever throughout your generations: as you are, so shall the foreigner be before HASHEM. 
verse:15:16 One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner with you.'"
portion:Numbers 15:17 - 15:26
verse:15:17 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:15:18 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you come into the land where I bring you, 
verse:15:19 then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up a wave offering to HASHEM. 
verse:15:20 Of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a wave offering: as the wave offering of the threshing floor, so you shall heave it. 
verse:15:21 Of the first of your dough you shall give to HASHEM a wave offering throughout your generations.
verse:15:22 "'When you shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which HASHEM has spoken to Moses, 
verse:15:23 even all that HASHEM has commanded you by Moses, from the day that HASHEM gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations; 
verse:15:24 then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt offering, for a pleasant aroma to HASHEM, with the meal offering of it, and the drink offering of it, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering. 
verse:15:25 The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire to HASHEM, and their sin offering before HASHEM, for their error: 
verse:15:26 and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them; for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly.
portion:Numbers 15:27 - 15:41
verse:15:27 "'If one person sins unwittingly, then he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering. 
verse:15:28 The priest shall make atonement for the soul who errs, when he sins unwittingly, before HASHEM, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven. 
verse:15:29 You shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly, for him who is native-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them.
verse:15:30 "'But the soul who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native-born or a foreigner, the same blasphemes HASHEM; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
verse:15:31 Because he has despised the word of HASHEM, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be on him.'"
verse:15:32 While the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day. 
verse:15:33 Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation. 
verse:15:34 They put him in custody, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.
verse:15:35 HASHEM said to Moses, "The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside of the camp." 
verse:15:36 All the congregation brought him outside of the camp, and stoned him to death with stones; as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:15:37 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:15:38 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them that they should make themselves tzitzit in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the tzitzit of each border a cord of blue: 
verse:15:39 and it shall be to you for a tzitzit, that you may look on it, and remember all the commandments of HASHEM, and do them; and that you not follow after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you use to play the prostitute; 
verse:15:40 that you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God. 
verse:15:41 I am HASHEM your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am HASHEM your God.
portion:Numbers 15:37 - 15:41
verse:15:37 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:15:38 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them that they should make themselves tzitzit in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the tzitzit of each border a cord of blue: 
verse:15:39 and it shall be to you for a tzitzit, that you may look on it, and remember all the commandments of HASHEM, and do them; and that you not follow after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you use to play the prostitute; 
verse:15:40 that you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God. 
verse:15:41 I am HASHEM your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am HASHEM your God."
portion:Numbers 16:1 - 16:13
verse:16:1 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men: 
verse:16:2 and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown; 
verse:16:3 and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, "You take too much on yourself, since all the congregation are holy, everyone of them, and HASHEM is among them: why then lift yourselves up above the assembly of HASHEM?"
verse:16:4 When Moses heard it, he fell on his face: 
verse:16:5 and he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, "In the morning HASHEM will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to him: even him whom he shall choose he will cause to come near to him. 
verse:16:6 Do this: take censers, Korah, and all his company; 
verse:16:7 and put fire in them, and put incense on them before HASHEM tomorrow: and it shall be that the man whom HASHEM chooses, he shall be holy. You have gone too far, you sons of Levi!"
verse:16:8 Moses said to Korah, "Hear now, you sons of Levi! 
verse:16:9 Is it a small thing to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of HASHEM, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them; 
verse:16:10 and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? and do you seek the priesthood also? 
verse:16:11 Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against HASHEM: and Aaron, what is he that you murmur against him?"
verse:16:12 Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, "We won't come up: 
verse:16:13 is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a prince over us?
portion:Numbers 16:14 - 16:19
verse:16:14 Moreover you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: will you put out the eyes of these men? We won't come up." 
verse:16:15 Moses was very angry, and said to HASHEM, "Don't respect their offering: I have not taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them." 
verse:16:16 Moses said to Korah, "You and all your company go before HASHEM, you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow: 
verse:16:17 and each man take his censer, and put incense on them, and each man bring before HASHEM his censer, two hundred fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer." 
verse:16:18 They each took his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron. 
verse:16:19 Korah assembled all the congregation against them to the door of the Tent of Meeting: and the glory of HASHEM appeared to all the congregation.
portion:Numbers 16:20 - 17:8
verse:16:20 HASHEM spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
verse:16:21 "Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!" 
verse:16:22 They fell on their faces, and said, "God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?"
verse:16:23 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:16:24 "Speak to the congregation, saying, 'Get away from around the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram!'" 
verse:16:25 Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him. 
verse:16:26 He spoke to the congregation, saying, "Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins!"
verse:16:27 So they went away from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones. 
verse:16:28 Moses said, "Hereby you shall know that HASHEM has sent me to do all these works; for they are not from my own mind. 
verse:16:29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then HASHEM hasn't sent me. 
verse:16:30 But if HASHEM make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain to them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then you shall understand that these men have despised HASHEM."
verse:16:31 It happened, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground split apart that was under them; 
verse:16:32 and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men who appertained to Korah, and all their goods. 
verse:16:33 So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed on them, and they perished from among the assembly. 
verse:16:34 All Israel that were around them fled at their cry; for they said, "Lest the earth swallow us up!" 
verse:16:35 Fire came forth from HASHEM, and devoured the two hundred fifty men who offered the incense.
verse:17:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:17:2 "Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter the fire yonder; for they are holy, 
verse:17:3 even the censers of these sinners against their own lives; and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before HASHEM; therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel." 
verse:17:4 Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar, 
verse:17:5 to be a memorial to the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger, who isn't of the seed of Aaron, comes near to burn incense before HASHEM; that he not be as Korah, and as his company: as HASHEM spoke to him by Moses. 
verse:17:6 But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, "You have killed HASHEM's people!" 
verse:17:7 It happened, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the Tent of Meeting: and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of HASHEM appeared. 
verse:17:8 Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of Meeting.
portion:Numbers 17:9 - 17:15
verse:17:9 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:17:10 "Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!" They fell on their faces.
verse:17:11 Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer, and put fire from off the altar in it, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from HASHEM! The plague has begun."
verse:17:12 Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and behold, the plague has begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people. 
verse:17:13 He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. 
verse:17:14 Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those who died about the matter of Korah. 
verse:17:15 Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the Tent of Meeting: and the plague was stayed.
portion:Numbers 17:16 - 17:24
verse:17:16 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:17:17 "Speak to the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers' house, of all their princes according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods: write every man's name on his rod. 
verse:17:18 You shall write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers' houses. 
verse:17:19 You shall lay them up in the Tent of Meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you. 
verse:17:20 It shall happen, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you."
verse:17:21 Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods. 
verse:17:22 Moses laid up the rods before HASHEM in the tent of the testimony.
verse:17:23 It happened on the next day, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds. 
verse:17:24 Moses brought out all the rods from before HASHEM to all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.
portion:Numbers 17:25 - 18:20
verse:17:25 HASHEM said to Moses, "Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that you may make an end of their murmurings against me, that they not die." 
verse:17:26 Moses did so. As HASHEM commanded him, so he did.
verse:17:27 The children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, "Behold, we perish! We are undone! We are all undone! 
verse:17:28 Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of HASHEM, dies! Will we all perish?"
verse:18:1 HASHEM said to Aaron, "You and your sons and your fathers' house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood. 
verse:18:2 Your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, bring near with you, that they may be joined to you, and minister to you: but you and your sons with you shall be before the tent of the testimony. 
verse:18:3 They shall keep your commands, and the duty of all the Tent: only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar, that they not die, neither they, nor you. 
verse:18:4 They shall be joined to you, and keep the responsibility of the Tent of Meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger shall not come near to you.
verse:18:5 "You shall perform the duty of the sanctuary, and the duty of the altar; that there be no more wrath on the children of Israel. 
verse:18:6 I, behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift, given to HASHEM, to do the service of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:18:7 You and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and you shall serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger who comes near shall be put to death."
verse:18:8 HASHEM spoke to Aaron, "I, behold, I have given you the command of my wave offerings, even all the holy things of the children of Israel; to you have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, as a portion forever. 
verse:18:9 This shall be yours of the most holy things from the fire: every offering of theirs, even every meal offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons. 
verse:18:10 You shall eat of it like the most holy things. Every male shall eat of it. It shall be holy to you.
verse:18:11 "This is yours, too: the wave offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the children of Israel. I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, as a portion forever. Everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it.
verse:18:12 "All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first fruits of them which they give to HASHEM, to you have I given them. 
verse:18:13 The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to HASHEM, shall be yours; everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it.
verse:18:14 "Everything devoted in Israel shall be yours. 
verse:18:15 Everything that opens the womb, of all flesh which they offer to HASHEM, both of man and animal shall be yours: nevertheless you shall surely redeem the firstborn of man, and you shall redeem the firstborn of unclean animals. 
verse:18:16 You shall redeem those who are to be redeemed of them from a month old, according to your estimation, for five shekels of money, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs).
verse:18:17 "But you shall not redeem the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat. They are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a pleasant aroma to HASHEM. 
verse:18:18 Their flesh shall be yours, as the wave offering breast and as the right thigh, it shall be yours. 
verse:18:19 All the wave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to HASHEM, have I given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, as a portion forever: it is a covenant of salt forever before HASHEM to you and to your seed with you."

verse:18:21 "To the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:18:22 Henceforth the children of Israel shall not come near the Tent of Meeting, lest they bear sin, and die. 
verse:18:23 But the Levites shall do the service of the Tent of Meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. 
verse:18:24 For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a wave offering to HASHEM, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said to them, 'Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.'"
verse:18:25 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:18:26 "Moreover you shall speak to the Levites, and tell them, 'When you take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall offer up a wave offering of it for HASHEM, a tithe of the tithe. 
verse:18:27 Your wave offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it were the grain of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the winepress. 
verse:18:28 Thus you also shall offer a wave offering to HASHEM of all your tithes, which you receive of the children of Israel; and of it you shall give HASHEM's wave offering to Aaron the priest. 
verse:18:29 Out of all your gifts you shall offer every wave offering of HASHEM, of all its best, even the holy part of it out of it.'
verse:18:30 "Therefore you shall tell them, 'When you heave its best from it, then it shall be reckoned to the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the winepress. 
verse:18:31 You shall eat it in every place, you and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the Tent of Meeting.

verse:19:3 You shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth outside of the camp, and one shall kill her before his face:

verse:19:7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening. 
verse:19:8 He who burns her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.
verse:19:9 "A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up outside of the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water for impurity: it is a sin offering. 
verse:19:10 He who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: and it shall be to the children of Israel, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them, for a statute forever.
verse:19:11 "He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days: 
verse:19:12 the same shall purify himself with water on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he doesn't purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean. 
verse:19:13 Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a man who has died, and doesn't purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of HASHEM; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet on him.

verse:20:1 The children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month: and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. 
verse:20:2 There was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. 
verse:20:3 The people strove with Moses, and spoke, saying, "We wish that we had died when our brothers died before HASHEM! 
verse:20:4 Why have you brought the assembly of HASHEM into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our animals? 
verse:20:5 Why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink."

verse:20:8 "Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and you shall bring forth to them water out of the rock; so you shall give the congregation and their livestock drink."
verse:20:9 Moses took the rod from before HASHEM, as he commanded him. 
verse:20:10 Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, "Hear now, you rebels; shall we bring you water out of this rock for you?" 
verse:20:11 Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their livestock.
verse:20:12 HASHEM said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you didn't believe in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them."
verse:20:13 These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with HASHEM, and he was sanctified in them.

verse:20:14 Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying: "Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the travail that has happened to us: 
verse:20:15 how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and our fathers: 
verse:20:16 and when we cried to HASHEM, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt: and behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of your border.
verse:20:17 "Please let us pass through your land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go along the king's highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your border."
verse:20:18 Edom said to him, "You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against you."
verse:20:19 The children of Israel said to him, "We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of your water, I and my livestock, then will I give its price: let me only, without doing anything else, pass through on my feet."
verse:20:20 He said, "You shall not pass through." Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand. 
verse:20:21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border, so Israel turned away from him.
portion:Numbers 20:22 - 21:9
verse:20:22 They traveled from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor. 
verse:20:23 HASHEM spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying, 
verse:20:24 "Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah. 
verse:20:25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor; 
verse:20:26 and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be taken, and shall die there."
verse:20:27 Moses did as HASHEM commanded: and they went up into Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. 
verse:20:28 Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.

verse:21:1 The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive. 
verse:21:2 Israel vowed a vow to HASHEM, and said, "If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities." 
verse:21:3 HASHEM listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and the name of the place was called Hormah.
verse:21:4 They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Sea of Suf, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. 
verse:21:5 The people spoke against God, and against Moses, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loathes this light bread."
verse:21:6 HASHEM sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many people of Israel died. 
verse:21:7 The people came to Moses, and said, "We have sinned, because we have spoken against HASHEM, and against you. Pray to HASHEM, that he take away the serpents from us." Moses prayed for the people.
verse:21:8 HASHEM said to Moses, "Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a standard: and it shall happen, that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live."

verse:21:12 From there they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered. 
verse:21:13 From there they traveled, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that comes out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 
verse:21:14 Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of HASHEM, "Vaheb in Suphah, the valleys of the Arnon, 
verse:21:15 the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moab."
verse:21:16 From there they traveled to Beer: that is the well of which HASHEM said to Moses, "Gather the people together, and I will give them water."
verse:21:17 Then sang Israel this song: "Spring up, well; sing to it: 
verse:21:18 the well, which the princes dug, which the nobles of the people dug, with the scepter, and with their poles." 
From the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah; 
verse:21:19 and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;

verse:21:22 "Let me pass through your land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's highway, until we have passed your border."
verse:21:23 Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel. 
verse:21:24 Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. 
verse:21:25 Israel took all these cities: and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its towns. 
verse:21:26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon. 
verse:21:27 Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, "Come to Heshbon. Let the city of Sihon be built and established; 
verse:21:28 for a fire has gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It has devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of the Arnon. 
verse:21:29 Woe to you, Moab! You are undone, people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites. 
verse:21:30 We have shot at them. Heshbon has perished even to Dibon. We have laid waste even to Nophah, Which reaches to Medeba."
verse:21:31 Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites. 
verse:21:32 Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took its towns, and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
verse:21:33 They turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.

Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. 
verse:22:5 He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, "Behold, there is a people who came out from Egypt. Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they are staying opposite me. 
verse:22:6 Please come now therefore curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed."
verse:22:7 The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak. 
verse:22:8 He said to them, "Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as HASHEM shall speak to me." The princes of Moab stayed with Balaam. 
verse:22:9 God came to Balaam, and said, "Who are these men with you?" 
verse:22:10 Balaam said to God, "Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has said to me, 
verse:22:11 'Behold, the people that has come out of Egypt, it covers the surface of the earth: now, come curse me them; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.'"

verse:22:15 Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they. 
verse:22:16 They came to Balaam, and said to him, "Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, 'Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me: 
verse:22:17 for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.'"
verse:22:18 Balaam answered the servants of Balak, "If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word of HASHEM my God, to do less or more. 
verse:22:19 Now therefore, please wait also here this night, that I may know what HASHEM will speak to me more."

verse:22:21 Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab. 
verse:22:22 God's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of HASHEM placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him. 
verse:22:23 The donkey saw the angel of HASHEM standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the way. 
verse:22:24 Then the angel of HASHEM stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side. 
verse:22:25 The donkey saw the angel of HASHEM, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he struck her again.
verse:22:26 The angel of HASHEM went further, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. 
verse:22:27 The donkey saw the angel of HASHEM, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.
verse:22:28 HASHEM opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?"
verse:22:29 Balaam said to the donkey, "Because you have mocked me, I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you."
verse:22:30 The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to you?"
He said, "No."
verse:22:31 Then HASHEM opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of HASHEM standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face. 
verse:22:32 The angel of HASHEM said to him, "Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come forth as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me: 
verse:22:33 and the donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times. Unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved her alive."
verse:22:34 Balaam said to the angel of HASHEM, "I have sinned; for I didn't know that you stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases you, I will go back again."
verse:22:35 The angel of HASHEM said to Balaam, "Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak."
So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. 
verse:22:36 When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border. 
verse:22:37 Balak said to Balaam, "Didn't I earnestly send to you to call you? Why didn't you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?"

He went to a bare height. 
verse:23:4 God met Balaam: and he said to him, "I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar."
verse:23:5 HASHEM put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak."
verse:23:6 He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab. 
verse:23:7 He took up his parable, and said, "From Aram has Balak brought me, the king of Moab from the mountains of the East. Come, curse Jacob for me. Come, defy Israel. 
verse:23:8 How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? How shall I defy whom HASHEM has not defied? 
verse:23:9 For from the top of the rocks I see him. From the hills I see him. Behold, it is a people that dwells alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations. 
verse:23:10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous! Let my last end be like his!"
verse:23:11 Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them altogether."
verse:23:12 He answered and said, "Must I not take heed to speak that which HASHEM puts in my mouth?"

verse:23:15 He said to Balak, "Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet over there."
verse:23:16 HASHEM met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and say this."
verse:23:17 He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. Balak said to him, "What has HASHEM spoken?"
verse:23:18 He took up his parable, and said, "Rise up, Balak, and hear! Listen to me, you son of Zippor. 
verse:23:19 God is not a man, that he should lie, nor the son of man, that he should repent. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good? 
verse:23:20 Behold, I have received a command to bless. He has blessed, and I can't reverse it. 
verse:23:21 He has not seen iniquity in Jacob. Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel. HASHEM his God is with him. The shout of a king is among them. 
verse:23:22 God brings them out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of the wild ox. 
verse:23:23 Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there any divination with Israel. Now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God done! 
verse:23:24 Behold, the people rises up as a lioness, As a lion he lifts himself up. He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drinks the blood of the slain."
verse:23:25 Balak said to Balaam, "Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all."

verse:24:2 Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him. 
verse:24:3 He took up his parable, and said, "Balaam the son of Beor says, the man whose eye was closed says; 
verse:24:4 he says, who hears the words of God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, and having his eyes open:

verse:30:1 Moses told the children of Israel according to all that HASHEM commanded Moses.
portion:Numbers 30:2 - 30:17
verse:30:2 Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, "This is the thing which HASHEM has commanded. 
verse:30:3 When a man vows a vow to HASHEM, or swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
verse:30:4 "Also when a woman vows a vow to HASHEM, and binds herself by a bond, being in her father's house, in her youth, 
verse:30:5 and her father hears her vow, and her bond with which she has bound her soul, and her father holds his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand. 
verse:30:6 But if her father disallow her in the day that he hears, none of her vows, or of her bonds with which she has bound her soul, shall stand: and HASHEM will forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
verse:30:7 "If she has a husband, while her vows are on her, or the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul, 
verse:30:8 and her husband hears it, and hold his peace at her in the day that he hears it; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she has bound her soul shall stand. 
verse:30:9 But if her husband forbids her in the day that he hears it, then he shall make void her vow which is on her, and the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul: and HASHEM will forgive her.
verse:30:10 "But the vow of a widow, or of her who is divorced, everything with which she has bound her soul, shall stand against her.
verse:30:11 "If she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath, 
verse:30:12 and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and didn't disallow her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand. 
verse:30:13 But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband has made them void; and HASHEM will forgive her. 
verse:30:14 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. 
verse:30:15 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds, which are on her: he has established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them. 
verse:30:16 But if he shall make them null and void after that he has heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity."
verse:30:17 These are the statutes, which HASHEM commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father's house.

verse:31:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:31:2 "Avenge the children of Israel for the Midianites. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people."

verse:31:4 Of every tribe one thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, you shall send to the war." 
verse:31:5 So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. 
verse:31:6 Moses sent them, one thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the shofars for the alarm in his hand. 
verse:31:7 They warred against Midian, as HASHEM commanded Moses; and they killed every male. 
verse:31:8 They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they killed with the sword. 
verse:31:9 The children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their livestock, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey. 
verse:31:10 All their cities in the places in which they lived, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire. 
verse:31:11 They took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of animal.

verse:31:14 Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war. 
verse:31:15 Moses said to them, "Have you saved all the women alive? 
verse:31:16 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against HASHEM in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of HASHEM. 
verse:31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him. 
verse:31:18 But all the girls, who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
verse:31:19 "Encamp outside of the camp seven days: whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives. 
verse:31:20 As to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood, you shall purify yourselves."
verse:31:21 Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, "This is the statute of the law which HASHEM has commanded Moses: 
verse:31:22 however the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 
verse:31:23 everything that may withstand the fire, you shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity: and all that doesn't withstand the fire you shall make to go through the water. 
verse:31:24 You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean; and afterward you shall come into the camp."
portion:Numbers 31:25 - 31:41
verse:31:25 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:31:26 "Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of animal, you, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers' households of the congregation; 
verse:31:27 and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation. 
verse:31:28 Levy a tribute to HASHEM of the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred; of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks. 
verse:31:29 Take it of their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for HASHEM's wave offering. 
verse:31:30 Of the children of Israel's half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of all the livestock, and give them to the Levites, who perform the duty of the tabernacle of HASHEM."
verse:31:31 Moses and Eleazar the priest did as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:31:32 Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep, 
verse:31:33 and seventy-two thousand head of cattle, 
verse:31:34 and sixty-one thousand donkeys, 
verse:31:35 and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the women who had not known man by lying with him. 
verse:31:36 The half, which was the portion of those who went out to war, was in number three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep: 
verse:31:37 and HASHEM's tribute of the sheep was six hundred seventy-five. 
verse:31:38 The cattle were thirty-six thousand; of which HASHEM's tribute was seventy-two. 
verse:31:39 The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred; of which HASHEM's tribute was sixty-one. 
verse:31:40 The persons were sixteen thousand; of whom HASHEM's tribute was thirty-two persons.

verse:31:44 and thirty-six thousand head of cattle, 
verse:31:45 and thirty thousand five hundred donkeys, 
verse:31:46 and sixteen thousand persons), 
verse:31:47 even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animal, and gave them to the Levites, who performed the duty of the tabernacle of HASHEM; as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:31:48 The officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near to Moses; 
verse:31:49 and they said to Moses, "Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our command, and there lacks not one man of us. 
verse:31:50 We have brought HASHEM's offering, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for our souls before HASHEM."
verse:31:51 Moses and Eleazar the priest took their gold, even all worked jewels. 
verse:31:52 All the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to HASHEM, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels. 
verse:31:53 (The men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)

portion:Numbers 32:1 - 32:19
verse:32:1 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold, the place was a place for livestock; 
verse:32:2 the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying, 
verse:32:3 "Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon, 
verse:32:4 the land which HASHEM struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock; and your servants have livestock." 
verse:32:5 They said, "If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession; don't bring us over the Jordan."
verse:32:6 Moses said to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, "Shall your brothers go to the war, and shall you sit here? 
verse:32:7 Why do you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which HASHEM has given them? 
verse:32:8 Your fathers did so when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land. 
verse:32:9 For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which HASHEM had given them. 
verse:32:10 HASHEM's anger was kindled in that day, and he swore, saying, 
verse:32:11 'Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me: 
verse:32:12 except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have followed HASHEM completely.' 
verse:32:13 HASHEM's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, who had done evil in the sight of HASHEM, was consumed.
verse:32:14 "Behold, you have risen up in your fathers' place, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of HASHEM toward Israel. 
verse:32:15 For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all this people."
verse:32:16 They came near to him, and said, "We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones: 
verse:32:17 but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. 
verse:32:18 We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance. 
verse:32:19 For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward."
portion:Numbers 32:20 - 32:42
verse:32:20 Moses said to them, "If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves to go before HASHEM to the war, 
verse:32:21 and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before HASHEM, until he has driven out his enemies from before him, 
verse:32:22 and the land is subdued before HASHEM; then afterward you shall return, and be guiltless towards HASHEM, and towards Israel; and this land shall be to you for a possession before HASHEM.
verse:32:23 "But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against HASHEM; and be sure your sin will find you out. 
verse:32:24 Build cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth."
verse:32:25 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, "Your servants will do as my lord commands. 
verse:32:26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock, shall be there in the cities of Gilead; 
verse:32:27 but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before HASHEM to battle, as my lord says."
verse:32:28 So Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' households of the tribes of the children of Israel. 
verse:32:29 Moses said to them, "If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man who is armed to battle, before HASHEM, and the land shall be subdued before you; then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession: 
verse:32:30 but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan."
verse:32:31 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, "As HASHEM has said to your servants, so will we do. 
verse:32:32 We will pass over armed before HASHEM into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan."
verse:32:33 Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to its cities and borders, even the cities of the surrounding land.

verse:35:14 You shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge. 
verse:35:15 For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the foreigner living among them, shall these six cities be for refuge; that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there.
verse:35:16 "'But if he struck him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
verse:35:17 If he struck him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
verse:35:18 Or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
verse:35:19 The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death: when he meets him, he shall put him to death. 
verse:35:20 If he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died, 
verse:35:21 or in enmity struck him with his hand, so that he died; he who struck him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meets him.
verse:35:22 "'But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled on him anything without lying in wait, 
verse:35:23 or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him, and cast it on him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm; 
verse:35:24 then the congregation shall judge between the striker and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances; 
verse:35:25 and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, where he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
verse:35:26 "'But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, where he flees, 
verse:35:27 and the avenger of blood find him outside of the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kill the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood, 
verse:35:28 because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession.
verse:35:29 "'These things shall be for a statute and ordinance to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
verse:35:30 "'Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die.
verse:35:31 "'Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death.
verse:35:32 "'You shall take no ransom for him who is fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
verse:35:33 "'So you shall not pollute the land in which you are: for blood, it pollutes the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him who shed it. 
verse:35:34 You shall not defile the land which you inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I, HASHEM, dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.'"
portion:Numbers 36:1 - 36:13
verse:36:1 The heads of the fathers' households of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers' households of the children of Israel: 
verse:36:2 and they said, "HASHEM commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by HASHEM to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters. 
verse:36:3 If they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance. 
verse:36:4 When the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers."
verse:36:5 Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of HASHEM, saying, "The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right. 
verse:36:6 This is the thing which HASHEM does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married. 
verse:36:7 So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall all keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. 
verse:36:8 Every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers. 
verse:36:9 So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall each keep his own inheritance."
verse:36:10 The daughters of Zelophehad did as HASHEM commanded Moses: 
verse:36:11 for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons. 
verse:36:12 They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. 
verse:36:13 These are the commandments and the ordinances which HASHEM commanded by Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
portion:Numbers 36:11 - 36:13
verse:36:11 for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons. 
verse:36:12 They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. 
verse:36:13 These are the commandments and the ordinances which HASHEM commanded by Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
portion:Deuteronomy 1:1 - 1:10
verse:1:1 These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suf, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab. 
verse:1:2 It is eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea. 
verse:1:3 It happened in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that HASHEM had given him in commandment to them; 
verse:1:4 after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei. 
verse:1:5 Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, 
verse:1:6 "HASHEM our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have lived long enough in this mountain: 
verse:1:7 turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all the places near there, in the Arabah, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the seashore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. 
verse:1:8 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which HASHEM swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them."
verse:1:9 I spoke to you at that time, saying, "I am not able to bear you myself alone: 
verse:1:10 HASHEM your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this day as the stars of the sky for multitude.
portion:Deuteronomy 1:11 - 1:21
verse:1:11 HASHEM, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are, and bless you, as he has promised you! 
verse:1:12 How can I myself alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? 
verse:1:13 Take wise men of understanding and well known according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you."
verse:1:14 You answered me, and said, "The thing which you have spoken is good to do." 
verse:1:15 So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes. 
verse:1:16 I commanded your judges at that time, saying, "Hear cases between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him. 
verse:1:17 You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike; you shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it." 
verse:1:18 I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do. 
verse:1:19 We traveled from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as HASHEM our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea. 
verse:1:20 I said to you, "You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which HASHEM our God gives to us. 
verse:1:21 Behold, HASHEM your God has set the land before you: go up, take possession, as HASHEM, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you; don't be afraid, neither be dismayed."
portion:Deuteronomy 1:22 - 1:38
verse:1:22 You came near to me everyone of you, and said, "Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come."
verse:1:23 The thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe: 
verse:1:24 and they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out. 
verse:1:25 They took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, "It is a good land which HASHEM our God gives to us."
verse:1:26 Yet you wouldn't go up, but rebelled against the commandment of HASHEM your God: 
verse:1:27 and you murmured in your tents, and said, "Because HASHEM hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. 
verse:1:28 Where are we going up? our brothers have made our heart to melt, saying, 'The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to the sky; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.'"
verse:1:29 Then I said to you, "Don't dread, neither be afraid of them. 
verse:1:30 HASHEM your God who goes before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes, 
verse:1:31 and in the wilderness, where you have seen how that HASHEM your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place."
verse:1:32 Yet in this thing you didn't believe HASHEM your God, 
verse:1:33 who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day. 
verse:1:34 HASHEM heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying, 
verse:1:35 "Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land, which I swore to give to your fathers, 
verse:1:36 except Caleb the son of Jephunneh: he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he has trodden on, and to his children, because he has wholly followed HASHEM."
verse:1:37 Also HASHEM was angry with me for your sakes, saying, "You also shall not go in there: 
verse:1:38 Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there: encourage you him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
portion:Deuteronomy 1:39 - 2:1
verse:1:39 Moreover your little ones, whom you said should be a prey, and your children, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it. 
verse:1:40 But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Sea of Suf."
verse:1:41 Then you answered and said to me, "We have sinned against HASHEM, we will go up and fight, according to all that HASHEM our God commanded us." Every man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill country.
verse:1:42 HASHEM said to me, "Tell them, 'Don't go up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest you be struck before your enemies.'"
verse:1:43 So I spoke to you, and you didn't listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of HASHEM, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country. 
verse:1:44 The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah. 
verse:1:45 You returned and wept before HASHEM; but HASHEM didn't listen to your voice, nor gave ear to you. 
verse:1:46 So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained.
verse:2:1 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Sea of Suf, as HASHEM spoke to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many days.
portion:Deuteronomy 2:2 - 2:30
verse:2:2 HASHEM spoke to me, saying, 
verse:2:3 "You have encircled this mountain long enough. Turn northward. 
verse:2:4 Command the people, saying, 'You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: take good heed to yourselves therefore; 
verse:2:5 don't contend with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession. 
verse:2:6 You shall purchase food of them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.'"
verse:2:7 For HASHEM your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand; he has known your walking through this great wilderness: these forty years HASHEM your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.
verse:2:8 So we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
verse:2:9 HASHEM said to me, "Don't bother Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession."
verse:2:10 (The Emim lived therein before, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim: 
verse:2:11 these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim. 
verse:2:12 The Horites also lived in Seir before, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which HASHEM gave to them.)
verse:2:13 "Now rise up, and cross over the brook Zered." We went over the brook Zered. 
verse:2:14 The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea, until we had come over the brook Zered, were thirty-eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as HASHEM swore to them. 
verse:2:15 Moreover the hand of HASHEM was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed. 
verse:2:16 So it happened, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, 
verse:2:17 that HASHEM spoke to me, saying, 
verse:2:18 "You are this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab: 
verse:2:19 and when you come near over against the children of Ammon, don't bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession."
verse:2:20 (That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim lived therein before; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, 
verse:2:21 a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but HASHEM destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place; 
verse:2:22 as he did for the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day: 
verse:2:23 and the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and lived in their place.)
verse:2:24 "Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. 
verse:2:25 This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you."
verse:2:26 I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 
verse:2:27 "Let me pass through your land: I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left. 
verse:2:28 You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet, 
verse:2:29 as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me; until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which HASHEM our God gives us." 
verse:2:30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for HASHEM your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as at this day.
portion:Deuteronomy 2:31 - 3:14
verse:2:31 HASHEM said to me, "Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you: begin to possess, that you may inherit his land." 
verse:2:32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz. 
verse:2:33 HASHEM our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him, and his sons, and all his people. 
verse:2:34 We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining: 
verse:2:35 only the livestock we took for a prey to ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken. 
verse:2:36 From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; HASHEM our God delivered up all before us: 
verse:2:37 only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn't come near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever HASHEM our God forbade us.
verse:3:1 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 
verse:3:2 HASHEM said to me, "Don't fear him; for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into your hand; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon."
verse:3:3 So HASHEM our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we struck him until none was left to him remaining. 
verse:3:4 We took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we didn't take from them; sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
verse:3:5 All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns a great many. 
verse:3:6 We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. 
verse:3:7 But all the livestock, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves. 
verse:3:8 We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon. 
verse:3:9 (The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir.) 
verse:3:10 We took all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
verse:3:11 (For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; isn't it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, after the cubit of a man.) 
verse:3:12 This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead, and its cities, gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites: 
verse:3:13 and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim. 
verse:3:14 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day.)
portion:Deuteronomy 3:15 - 3:22
verse:3:15 I gave Gilead to Machir. 
verse:3:16 To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 
verse:3:17 the Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.
verse:3:18 I commanded you at that time, saying, "HASHEM your God has given you this land to possess it: you shall pass over armed before your brothers the children of Israel, all the men of valor. 
verse:3:19 But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you, 
verse:3:20 until HASHEM gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which HASHEM your God gives them beyond the Jordan: then you shall return every man to his possession, which I have given you."
verse:3:21 I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, "Your eyes have seen all that HASHEM your God has done to these two kings: so shall HASHEM do to all the kingdoms where you go over. 
verse:3:22 You shall not fear them; for HASHEM your God, he it is who fights for you."
portion:Deuteronomy 3:20 - 3:22
verse:3:20 until HASHEM gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which HASHEM your God gives them beyond the Jordan: then you shall return every man to his possession, which I have given you."
verse:3:21 I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, "Your eyes have seen all that HASHEM your God has done to these two kings: so shall HASHEM do to all the kingdoms where you go over. 
verse:3:22 You shall not fear them; for HASHEM your God, he it is who fights for you."
portion:Deuteronomy 3:23 - 4:4
verse:3:23 I begged HASHEM at that time, saying, 
verse:3:24 "My Lord HASHEM, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your strong hand: for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to your works, and according to your mighty acts? 
verse:3:25 Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon."
verse:3:26 But HASHEM was angry with me for your sakes, and didn't listen to me; and HASHEM said to me, "Let it suffice you; speak no more to me of this matter. 
verse:3:27 Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes: for you shall not go over this Jordan. 
verse:3:28 But commission Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see." 
verse:3:29 So we stayed in the valley over against Beth Peor.
verse:4:1 Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that you may live, and go in and possess the land which HASHEM, the God of your fathers, gives you. 
verse:4:2 You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish from it, that you may keep the commandments of HASHEM your God which I command you. 
verse:4:3 Your eyes have seen what HASHEM did because of Baal Peor; for all the men who followed Baal Peor, HASHEM your God has destroyed them from the midst of you. 
verse:4:4 But you who were faithful to HASHEM your God are all alive this day.
portion:Deuteronomy 4:5 - 4:40
verse:4:5 Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as HASHEM my God commanded me, that you should do so in the midst of the land where you go in to possess it. 
verse:4:6 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who shall hear all these statutes, and say, "Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people." 
verse:4:7 For what great nation is there, that has a god so near to them, as HASHEM our God is whenever we call on him? 
verse:4:8 What great nation is there, that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
verse:4:9 Only take heed to yourself, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your children and your children's children; 
verse:4:10 the day that you stood before HASHEM your God in Horeb, when HASHEM said to me, "Assemble me the people, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children." 
verse:4:11 You came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. 
verse:4:12 HASHEM spoke to you out of the midst of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; you only heard a voice. 
verse:4:13 He declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them on two tables of stone. 
verse:4:14 HASHEM commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it. 
verse:4:15 Take therefore good heed to yourselves; for you saw no kind of form on the day that HASHEM spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire. 
verse:4:16 Lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself an engraved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female, 
verse:4:17 the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky, 
verse:4:18 the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth; 
verse:4:19 and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which HASHEM your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole sky. 
verse:4:20 But HASHEM has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as at this day. 
verse:4:21 Furthermore HASHEM was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land, which HASHEM your God gives you for an inheritance: 
verse:4:22 but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but you shall go over, and possess that good land. 
verse:4:23 Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of HASHEM your God, which he made with you, and make you an engraved image in the form of anything which HASHEM your God has forbidden you. 
verse:4:24 For HASHEM your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God. 
verse:4:25 When you shall father children, and children's children, and you shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make an engraved image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of HASHEM your God, to provoke him to anger; 
verse:4:26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto you go over the Jordan to possess it; you shall not prolong your days on it, but shall utterly be destroyed. 
verse:4:27 HASHEM will scatter you among the peoples, and you shall be left few in number among the nations, where HASHEM shall lead you away. 
verse:4:28 There you shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. 
verse:4:29 But from there you shall seek HASHEM your God, and you shall find him, when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul. 
verse:4:30 When you are in oppression, and all these things have come on you, in the latter days you shall return to HASHEM your God, and listen to his voice: 
verse:4:31 for HASHEM your God is a merciful God; he will not fail you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore to them. 
verse:4:32 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and from the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has been anything as this great thing is, or has been heard like it? 
verse:4:33 Did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live? 
verse:4:34 Or has God tried to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that HASHEM your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? 
verse:4:35 It was shown to you so that you might know that HASHEM is God. There is no one else besides him. 
verse:4:36 Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you: and on earth he made you to see his great fire; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire. 
verse:4:37 Because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought you out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt; 
verse:4:38 to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as at this day. 
verse:4:39 Know therefore this day, and lay it to your heart, that HASHEM he is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is none else. 
verse:4:40 You shall keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land, which HASHEM your God gives you, forever.

verse:4:41 Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise; 
verse:4:42 that the manslayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unawares, and didn't hate him in time past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live: 
verse:4:43 Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites. 
verse:4:44 This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel: 
verse:4:45 these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt, 
verse:4:46 beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel struck, when they came forth out of Egypt. 
verse:4:47 They took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise; 
verse:4:48 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even to Mount Sion (the same is Hermon), 
verse:4:49 and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.

verse:5:4 HASHEM spoke with you face to face on the mountain out of the midst of the fire,

verse:5:6 "I am HASHEM your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
verse:5:7 "You shall have no other gods before me.
verse:5:8 "You shall not make an engraved image for yourself, any likeness of what is in heaven above, or what is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: 
verse:5:9 you shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them; for I, HASHEM, your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me; 
verse:5:10 and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
verse:5:11 "You shall not take the name of HASHEM your God in vain: for HASHEM will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.
verse:5:12 "Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as HASHEM your God commanded you. 
verse:5:13 You shall labor six days, and do all your work; 
verse:5:14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to HASHEM your God, in which you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates; that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you. 
verse:5:15 You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and HASHEM your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm: therefore HASHEM your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
verse:5:16 "Honor your father and your mother, as HASHEM your God commanded you; that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you, in the land which HASHEM your God gives you.

portion:Deuteronomy 5:19 - 6:3
verse:5:19 These words HASHEM spoke to all your assembly on the mountain out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. He wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me. 
verse:5:20 It happened, when you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; 
verse:5:21 and you said, "Behold, HASHEM our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God does speak with man, and he lives. 
verse:5:22 Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of HASHEM our God any more, then we shall die. 
verse:5:23 For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? 
verse:5:24 Go near, and hear all that HASHEM our God shall say: and tell us all that HASHEM our God shall tell you; and we will hear it, and do it."
verse:5:25 HASHEM heard the voice of your words, when you spoke to me; and HASHEM said to me, "I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you: they have well said all that they have spoken. 
verse:5:26 Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children forever!
verse:5:27 "Go tell them, Return to your tents. 
verse:5:28 But as for you, stand here by me, and I will tell you all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it."
verse:5:29 You shall observe to do therefore as HASHEM your God has commanded you: you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. 
verse:5:30 You shall walk in all the way which HASHEM your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.
verse:6:1 Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances, which HASHEM your God commanded to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it; 
verse:6:2 that you might fear HASHEM your God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, you, and your son, and your son's son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged. 
verse:6:3 Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as HASHEM, the God of your fathers, has promised to you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.

verse:6:4 Hear, Israel: HASHEM is our God; HASHEM is one: 
verse:6:5 and you shall love HASHEM your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might. 
verse:6:6 These words, which I command you this day, shall be on your heart; 
verse:6:7 and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up. 
verse:6:8 You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for symbols between your eyes. 
verse:6:9 You shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates. 
verse:6:10 It shall be, when HASHEM your God shall bring you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and goodly cities, which you didn't build, 
verse:6:11 and houses full of all good things, which you didn't fill, and cisterns dug out, which you didn't dig, vineyards and olive trees, which you didn't plant, and you shall eat and be full; 
verse:6:12 then beware lest you forget HASHEM, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 
verse:6:13 You shall fear HASHEM your God; and you shall serve him, and shall swear by his name. 
verse:6:14 You shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples who are around you; 
verse:6:15 for HASHEM your God in the midst of you is a jealous God; lest the anger of HASHEM your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth. 
verse:6:16 You shall not tempt HASHEM your God, as you tempted him in Massah. 
verse:6:17 You shall diligently keep the commandments of HASHEM your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you.

verse:6:19 to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as HASHEM has spoken.
verse:6:20 When your son asks you in time to come, saying, "What do the testimonies, the statutes, and the ordinances, which HASHEM our God has commanded you mean?" 
verse:6:21 then you shall tell your son, "We were Pharaoh's bondservants in Egypt: and HASHEM brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand; 
verse:6:22 and HASHEM showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes; 
verse:6:23 and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers. 
verse:6:24 HASHEM commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear HASHEM our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as at this day. 
verse:6:25 It shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all this commandment before HASHEM our God, as he has commanded us."

verse:7:1 When HASHEM your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before you, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than you; 
verse:7:2 and when HASHEM your God shall deliver them up before you, and you shall strike them; then you shall utterly destroy them: you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them; 
verse:7:3 neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you shall not give to his son, nor shall you take his daughter for your son. 
verse:7:4 For he will turn away your son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so the anger of HASHEM would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly. 
verse:7:5 But you shall deal with them like this: you shall break down their altars, and dash their pillars in pieces, and cut down their Asherim, and burn their engraved images with fire. 
verse:7:6 For you are a holy people to HASHEM your God: HASHEM your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth. 
verse:7:7 HASHEM didn't set his love on you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all peoples: 
verse:7:8 but because HASHEM loves you, and because he would keep the oath which he swore to your fathers, has HASHEM brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 
verse:7:9 Know therefore that HASHEM your God, he is God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with them who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations, 
verse:7:10 and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him who hates him, he will repay him to his face.

portion:Deuteronomy 7:12 - 8:10
verse:7:12 It shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances, and keep and do them, that HASHEM your God will keep with you the covenant and the loving kindness which he swore to your fathers: 
verse:7:13 and he will love you, and bless you, and multiply you; he will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock, in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you. 
verse:7:14 You shall be blessed above all peoples: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your livestock. 
verse:7:15 HASHEM will take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, he will put on you, but will lay them on all those who hate you. 
verse:7:16 You shall consume all the peoples whom HASHEM your God shall deliver to you; your eye shall not pity them: neither shall you serve their gods; for that will be a snare to you. 
verse:7:17 If you shall say in your heart, "These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?" 
verse:7:18 you shall not be afraid of them: you shall well remember what HASHEM your God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt; 
verse:7:19 the great trials which your eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which HASHEM your God brought you out: so shall HASHEM your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid. 
verse:7:20 Moreover HASHEM your God will send the hornet among them, until those who are left, and hide themselves, perish from before you. 
verse:7:21 You shall not be scared of them; for HASHEM your God is in the midst of you, a great and awesome God. 
verse:7:22 HASHEM your God will cast out those nations before you by little and little: you may not consume them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you. 
verse:7:23 But HASHEM your God will deliver them up before you, and will confuse them with a great confusion, until they be destroyed. 
verse:7:24 He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name to perish from under the sky: no man shall be able to stand before you, until you have destroyed them. 
verse:7:25 You shall burn the engraved images of their gods with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared in it; for it is an abomination to HASHEM your God. 
verse:7:26 You shall not bring an abomination into your house, and become a devoted thing like it. You shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.
verse:8:1 You shall observe to do all the commandment which I command you this day, that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which HASHEM swore to your fathers. 
verse:8:2 You shall remember all the way which HASHEM your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or not. 
verse:8:3 He humbled you, and allowed you to be hungry, and fed you with manna, which you didn't know, neither did your fathers know; that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only, but man lives by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of HASHEM. 
verse:8:4 Your clothing didn't grow old on you, neither did your foot swell, these forty years. 
verse:8:5 You shall consider in your heart that as a man chastens his son, so HASHEM your God chastens you. 
verse:8:6 You shall keep the commandments of HASHEM your God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him. 
verse:8:7 For HASHEM your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of springs, and underground water flowing into valleys and hills; 
verse:8:8 a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates; a land of olive trees and honey; 
verse:8:9 a land in which you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig copper. 
verse:8:10 You shall eat and be full, and you shall bless HASHEM your God for the good land which he has given you.
portion:Deuteronomy 8:11 - 9:3
verse:8:11 Beware lest you forget HASHEM your God, in not keeping his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command you this day: 
verse:8:12 lest, when you have eaten and are full, and have built goodly houses, and lived therein; 
verse:8:13 and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied; 
verse:8:14 then your heart be lifted up, and you forget HASHEM your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; 
verse:8:15 who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where there was no water; who brought you forth water out of the rock of flint; 
verse:8:16 who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers didn't know; that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end: 
verse:8:17 and lest you say in your heart, "My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth." 
verse:8:18 But you shall remember HASHEM your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as at this day.
verse:8:19 It shall be, if you shall forget HASHEM your God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish. 
verse:8:20 As the nations that HASHEM makes to perish before you, so you shall perish; because you wouldn't listen to the voice of HASHEM your God.
verse:9:1 Hear, Israel: you are to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the sky, 
verse:9:2 a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say, "Who can stand before the sons of Anak?" 
verse:9:3 Know therefore this day, that HASHEM your God is he who goes over before you as a devouring fire; he will destroy them, and he will bring them down before you: so you shall drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as HASHEM has spoken to you.
portion:Deuteronomy 9:4 - 9:29
verse:9:4 Don't say in your heart, after HASHEM your God has thrust them out from before you, saying, "For my righteousness HASHEM has brought me in to possess this land;" because HASHEM drives them out before you because of the wickedness of these nations. 
verse:9:5 Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart, do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations HASHEM your God does drive them out from before you, and that he may establish the word which HASHEM swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
verse:9:6 Know therefore, that HASHEM your God doesn't give you this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people. 
verse:9:7 Remember, don't forget, how you provoked HASHEM your God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt, until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against HASHEM. 
verse:9:8 Also in Horeb you provoked HASHEM to wrath, and HASHEM was angry with you to destroy you. 
verse:9:9 When I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which HASHEM made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water. 
verse:9:10 HASHEM delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them were all the words which HASHEM spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
verse:9:11 It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that HASHEM gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant. 
verse:9:12 HASHEM said to me, "Arise, get down quickly from here; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image."
verse:9:13 Furthermore HASHEM spoke to me, saying, "I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people: 
verse:9:14 let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they."
verse:9:15 So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands. 
verse:9:16 I looked, and behold, you had sinned against HASHEM your God; you had made yourselves a molten calf: you had turned aside quickly out of the way which HASHEM had commanded you. 
verse:9:17 I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes. 
verse:9:18 I fell down before HASHEM, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water; because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of HASHEM, to provoke him to anger. 
verse:9:19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, with which HASHEM was angry against you to destroy you. But HASHEM listened to me that time also. 
verse:9:20 HASHEM was very angry with Aaron to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. 
verse:9:21 I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast its dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain. 
verse:9:22 At Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah, you provoked HASHEM to wrath. 
verse:9:23 When HASHEM sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, "Go up and possess the land which I have given you;" then you rebelled against the commandment of HASHEM your God, and you didn't believe him, nor listen to his voice. 
verse:9:24 You have been rebellious against HASHEM from the day that I knew you. 
verse:9:25 So I fell down before HASHEM the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because HASHEM had said he would destroy you. 
verse:9:26 I prayed to HASHEM, and said, "HASHEM GOD, don't destroy your people and your inheritance, that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 
verse:9:27 Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; don't look to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin, 
verse:9:28 lest the land you brought us out from say, 'Because HASHEM was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.' 
verse:9:29 Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm."
portion:Deuteronomy 10:1 - 10:11
verse:10:1 At that time HASHEM said to me, "Cut two tables of stone like the first, and come up to me onto the mountain, and make an ark of wood. 
verse:10:2 I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark." 
verse:10:3 So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two tables of stone like the first, and went up onto the mountain, having the two tables in my hand. 
verse:10:4 He wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which HASHEM spoke to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and HASHEM gave them to me. 
verse:10:5 I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are as HASHEM commanded me. 
verse:10:6 (The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his place. 
verse:10:7 From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water. 
verse:10:8 At that time HASHEM set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of HASHEM, to stand before HASHEM to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day. 
verse:10:9 Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers; HASHEM is his inheritance, according as HASHEM your God spoke to him.) 
verse:10:10 I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and HASHEM listened to me that time also; HASHEM would not destroy you. 
verse:10:11 HASHEM said to me, "Arise, take your journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them."
portion:Deuteronomy 10:12 - 11:9
verse:10:12 Now, Israel, what does HASHEM your God require of you, but to fear HASHEM your God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve HASHEM your God with all your heart and with all your soul, 
verse:10:13 to keep the commandments of HASHEM, and his statutes, which I command you this day for your good? 
verse:10:14 Behold, to HASHEM your God belongs heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein. 
verse:10:15 Only HASHEM had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples, as at this day. 
verse:10:16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked. 
verse:10:17 For HASHEM your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awesome, who doesn't respect persons, nor takes reward. 
verse:10:18 He does execute justice for the fatherless and widow, and loves the foreigner, in giving him food and clothing. 
verse:10:19 Therefore love the foreigner; for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. 
verse:10:20 You shall fear HASHEM your God; you shall serve him; and you shall cling to him, and you shall swear by his name. 
verse:10:21 He is your praise, and he is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things, which your eyes have seen. 
verse:10:22 Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now HASHEM your God has made you as the stars of the sky for multitude.
verse:11:1 Therefore you shall love HASHEM your God, and keep his instructions, and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments, always. 
verse:11:2 Know this day: for I don't speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of HASHEM your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his outstretched arm, 
verse:11:3 and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land; 
verse:11:4 and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Sea of Suf to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how HASHEM has destroyed them to this day; 
verse:11:5 and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place; 
verse:11:6 and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel: 
verse:11:7 but your eyes have seen all the great work of HASHEM which he did. 
verse:11:8 Therefore you shall keep all the commandment which I command you this day, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land, where you go over to possess it; 
verse:11:9 and that you may prolong your days in the land, which HASHEM swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.

verse:11:10 For the land, where you go in to possess it, isn't as the land of Egypt, that you came out from, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs; 
verse:11:11 but the land, where you go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water of the rain of the sky, 
verse:11:12 a land which HASHEM your God cares for: the eyes of HASHEM your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year. 
verse:11:13 It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love HASHEM your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,

verse:11:15 I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full. 
verse:11:16 Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 
verse:11:17 and the anger of HASHEM be kindled against you, and he shut up the sky, so that there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield its fruit; and you perish quickly from off the good land which HASHEM gives you. 
verse:11:18 Therefore you shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and you shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for symbols between your eyes. 
verse:11:19 You shall teach them your children, talking of them, when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up. 
verse:11:20 You shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates;

portion:Deuteronomy 11:22 - 11:25
verse:11:22 For if you shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to love HASHEM your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cling to him;

verse:11:24 Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the hinder sea shall be your border. 
verse:11:25 No man shall be able to stand before you: HASHEM your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread on, as he has spoken to you.
portion:Deuteronomy 11:26 - 12:10
verse:11:26 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse: 
verse:11:27 the blessing, if you shall listen to the commandments of HASHEM your God, which I command you this day; 
verse:11:28 and the curse, if you shall not listen to the commandments of HASHEM your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which you have not known. 
verse:11:29 It shall happen, when HASHEM your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal. 
verse:11:30 Aren't they beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?

verse:11:32 You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day.
verse:12:1 These are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which HASHEM, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess it, all the days that you live on the earth. 
verse:12:2 You shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree: 
verse:12:3 and you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods; and you shall destroy their name out of that place. 
verse:12:4 You shall not do so to HASHEM your God. 
verse:12:5 But to the place which HASHEM your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, even to his habitation you shall seek, and there you shall come; 
verse:12:6 and there you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the wave offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock: 
verse:12:7 and there you shall eat before HASHEM your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, in which HASHEM your God has blessed you. 
verse:12:8 You shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatever is right in his own eyes; 
verse:12:9 for you haven't yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which HASHEM your God gives you. 
verse:12:10 But when you go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which HASHEM your God causes you to inherit, and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you, so that you dwell in safety;
portion:Deuteronomy 12:11 - 12:28
verse:12:11 then it shall happen that to the place which HASHEM your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, there you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the wave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to HASHEM. 
verse:12:12 You shall rejoice before HASHEM your God, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your male servants, and your female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you. 
verse:12:13 Take heed to yourself that you don't offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see; 
verse:12:14 but in the place which HASHEM shall choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you. 
verse:12:15 Notwithstanding, you may kill and eat flesh within all your gates, after all the desire of your soul, according to the blessing of HASHEM your God which he has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart. 
verse:12:16 Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it out on the earth as water. 
verse:12:17 You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your freewill offerings, nor the wave offering of your hand; 
verse:12:18 but you shall eat them before HASHEM your God in the place which HASHEM your God shall choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your male servant, and your female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates: and you shall rejoice before HASHEM your God in all that you put your hand to. 
verse:12:19 Take heed to yourself that you don't forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.
verse:12:20 When HASHEM your God shall enlarge your border, as he has promised you, and you shall say, "I want to eat meat," because your soul desires to eat meat; you may eat meat, after all the desire of your soul. 
verse:12:21 If the place which HASHEM your God shall choose, to put his name there, is too far from you, then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock, which HASHEM has given you, as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates, after all the desire of your soul. 
verse:12:22 Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so you shall eat of it: the unclean and the clean may eat of it alike. 
verse:12:23 Only be sure that you don't eat the blood: for the blood is the life; and you shall not eat the life with the flesh. 
verse:12:24 You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the earth as water. 
verse:12:25 You shall not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of HASHEM. 
verse:12:26 Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take, and go to the place which HASHEM shall choose: 
verse:12:27 and you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of HASHEM your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of HASHEM your God; and you shall eat the flesh. 
verse:12:28 Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you forever, when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of HASHEM your God.
portion:Deuteronomy 12:29 - 13:19
verse:12:29 When HASHEM your God shall cut off the nations from before you, where you go in to dispossess them, and you dispossess them, and dwell in their land;

verse:12:31 You shall not do so to HASHEM your God: for every abomination to HASHEM, which he hates, have they done to their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods. 
verse:13:1 Whatever thing I command you, that you shall observe to do: you shall not add thereto, nor diminish from it.
verse:13:2 If there arise in the midst of you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he give you a sign or a wonder,

verse:13:4 you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or to that dreamer of dreams: for HASHEM your God proves you, to know whether you love HASHEM your God with all your heart and with all your soul. 
verse:13:5 You shall walk after HASHEM your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and you shall serve him, and cling to him. 
verse:13:6 That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he has spoken rebellion against HASHEM your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out of the way which HASHEM your God commanded you to walk in. So you shall put away the evil from the midst of you.
verse:13:7 If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend, who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, "Let us go and serve other gods," which you have not known, you, nor your fathers; 
verse:13:8 of the gods of the peoples who are around you, near to you, or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth; 
verse:13:9 you shall not consent to him, nor listen to him; neither shall your eye pity him, neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him: 
verse:13:10 but you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. 
verse:13:11 You shall stone him to death with stones, because he has sought to draw you away from HASHEM your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 
verse:13:12 All Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall not do any more such wickedness as this is in the midst of you.
verse:13:13 If you shall hear tell concerning one of your cities, which HASHEM your God gives you to dwell there, saying, 
verse:13:14 Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of you, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, "Let us go and serve other gods," which you have not known; 
verse:13:15 then you shall inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is done in the midst of you, 
verse:13:16 you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein and its livestock, with the edge of the sword. 
verse:13:17 You shall gather all its spoil into the midst of its street, and shall burn with fire the city, and all its spoil every whit, to HASHEM your God: and it shall be a heap forever; it shall not be built again. 
verse:13:18 Nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand; that HASHEM may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show you mercy, and have compassion on you, and multiply you, as he has sworn to your fathers; 
verse:13:19 when you shall listen to the voice of HASHEM your God, to keep all his commandments which I command you this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of HASHEM your God.
portion:Deuteronomy 14:1 - 14:21

verse:14:8 The pig, because it has a split hoof but doesn't chew the cud, is unclean to you: of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch. 
verse:14:9 These you may eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales may you eat; 
verse:14:10 and whatever doesn't have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean to you. 
verse:14:11 Of all clean birds you may eat. 
verse:14:12 But these are they of which you shall not eat: the eagle, and the vulture, and the osprey,

verse:14:14 and every raven after its kind, 
verse:14:15 and the ostrich, and the owl, and the seagull, and the hawk after its kind,

verse:14:21 You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself: you may give it to the foreigner living among you who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner: for you are a holy people to HASHEM your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.

verse:14:24 If the way is too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it, because the place is too far from you, which HASHEM your God shall choose, to set his name there, when HASHEM your God shall bless you; 
verse:14:25 then you shall turn it into money, and bind up the money in your hand, and shall go to the place which HASHEM your God shall choose: 
verse:14:26 and you shall bestow the money for whatever your soul desires, for cattle, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatever your soul asks of you; and you shall eat there before HASHEM your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your household. 
verse:14:27 The Levite who is within your gates, you shall not forsake him; for he has no portion nor inheritance with you. 
verse:14:28 At the end of every three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase in the same year, and shall lay it up within your gates:

portion:Deuteronomy 15:1 - 15:18
verse:15:1 At the end of every seven years you shall make a release. 
verse:15:2 This is the way of the release: every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother; because HASHEM's release has been proclaimed. 
verse:15:3 Of a foreigner you may exact it: but whatever of your is with your brother your hand shall release.

verse:15:9 Beware that there not be a base thought in your heart, saying, "The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand;" and your eye be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing; and he cry to HASHEM against you, and it be sin to you. 
verse:15:10 You shall surely give him, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him; because that for this thing HASHEM your God will bless you in all your work, and in all that you put your hand to. 
verse:15:11 For the poor will never cease out of the land: therefore I command you, saying, You shall surely open your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor, in your land. 
verse:15:12 If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you, and serves you six years; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you. 
verse:15:13 When you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty: 
verse:15:14 you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, and out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress; as HASHEM your God has blessed you, you shall give to him. 
verse:15:15 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land of Egypt, and HASHEM your God redeemed you: therefore I command you this thing today. 
verse:15:16 It shall be, if he tells you, "I will not go out from you;" because he loves you and your house, because he is well with you; 
verse:15:17 then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant forever. Also to your female servant you shall do likewise.

verse:18:1 The priests the Levites, all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of HASHEM made by fire, and his inheritance. 
verse:18:2 They shall have no inheritance among their brothers: HASHEM is their inheritance, as he has spoken to them. 
verse:18:3 This shall be the priests' due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw. 
verse:18:4 The first fruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, you shall give him. 
verse:18:5 For HASHEM your God has chosen him out of all your tribes, to stand to minister in the name of HASHEM, him and his sons for ever.
portion:Deuteronomy 18:6 - 18:13
verse:18:6 If a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel, where he lives as a foreigner, and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which HASHEM shall choose; 
verse:18:7 then he shall minister in the name of HASHEM his God, as all his brothers the Levites do, who stand there before HASHEM. 
verse:18:8 They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which comes of the sale of his patrimony. 
verse:18:9 When you have come into the land which HASHEM your God gives you, you shall not learn to do after the abominations of those nations. 
verse:18:10 There shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who practices sorcery, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer, 
verse:18:11 or a charmer, or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer. 
verse:18:12 For whoever does these things is an abomination to HASHEM: and because of these abominations HASHEM your God does drive them out from before you. 
verse:18:13 You shall be perfect with HASHEM your God.
portion:Deuteronomy 18:14 - 19:13
verse:18:14 For these nations, that you shall dispossess, listen to those who practice sorcery, and to diviners; but as for you, HASHEM your God has not allowed you so to do. 
verse:18:15 HASHEM your God will raise up to you a prophet from the midst of you, of your brothers, like me. You shall listen to him. 
verse:18:16 This is according to all that you desired of HASHEM your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, "Let me not hear again the voice of HASHEM my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I not die."
verse:18:17 HASHEM said to me, "They have well said that which they have spoken. 
verse:18:18 I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers, like you; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him. 
verse:18:19 It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him. 
verse:18:20 But the prophet, who shall speak a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die."
verse:18:21 If you say in your heart, "How shall we know the word which HASHEM has not spoken?" 
verse:18:22 when a prophet speaks in the name of HASHEM, if the thing doesn't follow, nor happen, that is the thing which HASHEM has not spoken: the prophet has spoken it presumptuously, you shall not be afraid of him.
verse:19:1 When HASHEM your God shall cut off the nations, whose land HASHEM your God gives you, and you succeed them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses; 
verse:19:2 you shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land, which HASHEM your God gives you to possess it. 
verse:19:3 You shall prepare you the way, and divide the borders of your land, which HASHEM your God causes you to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may flee there. 
verse:19:4 This is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee there and live: whoever kills his neighbor unawares, and didn't hate him in time past; 
verse:19:5 as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle, and lights on his neighbor, so that he dies; he shall flee to one of these cities and live: 
verse:19:6 lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he didn't hate him in time past. 
verse:19:7 Therefore I command you, saying, You shall set apart three cities for yourselves. 
verse:19:8 If HASHEM your God enlarges your border, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land which he promised to give to your fathers; 
verse:19:9 if you keep all this commandment to do it, which I command you this day, to love HASHEM your God, and to walk ever in his ways; then you shall add three cities more for yourselves, besides these three: 
verse:19:10 that innocent blood not be shed in the midst of your land, which HASHEM your God gives you for an inheritance, and so blood be on you. 
verse:19:11 But if any man hates his neighbor, and lies in wait for him, and rises up against him, and strikes him mortally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities; 
verse:19:12 then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. 
verse:19:13 Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall put away the innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with you.
portion:Deuteronomy 19:14 - 20:9
verse:19:14 You shall not remove your neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit, in the land that HASHEM your God gives you to possess it. 
verse:19:15 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established. 
verse:19:16 If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing, 
verse:19:17 then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before HASHEM, before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days; 
verse:19:18 and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother; 
verse:19:19 then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother: so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you. 
verse:19:20 Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of you. 
verse:19:21 Your eyes shall not pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
verse:20:1 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and see horses, chariots, and a people more than you, you shall not be afraid of them; for HASHEM your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. 
verse:20:2 It shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people, 
verse:20:3 and shall tell them, "Hear, Israel, you draw near this day to battle against your enemies: don't let your heart faint; don't be afraid, nor tremble, neither be scared of them; 
verse:20:4 for HASHEM your God is he who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you."
verse:20:5 The officers shall speak to the people, saying, "What man is there who has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. 
verse:20:6 What man is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use its fruit. 
verse:20:7 What man is there who has pledged to be married a wife, and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her." 
verse:20:8 The officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, "What man is there who is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go and return to his house, lest his brother's heart melt as his heart." 
verse:20:9 It shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people, that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people.
portion:Deuteronomy 20:10 - 21:9
verse:20:10 When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it. 
verse:20:11 It shall be, if it makes you answer of peace, and opens to you, then it shall be, that all the people who are found therein shall become tributary to you, and shall serve you. 
verse:20:12 If it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it: 
verse:20:13 and when HASHEM your God delivers it into your hand, you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the sword: 
verse:20:14 but the women, and the little ones, and the livestock, and all that is in the city, even all its spoil, you shall take for a prey to yourself; and you shall eat the spoil of your enemies, which HASHEM your God has given you. 
verse:20:15 Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations. 
verse:20:16 But of the cities of these peoples, that HASHEM your God gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes; 
verse:20:17 but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as HASHEM your God has commanded you; 
verse:20:18 that they not teach you to do after all their abominations, which they have done to their gods; so would you sin against HASHEM your God. 
verse:20:19 When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an axe against them; for you may eat of them, and you shall not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged of you? 
verse:20:20 Only the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food, you shall destroy and cut them down; and you shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it fall.
verse:21:1 If one be found slain in the land which HASHEM your God gives you to possess it, lying in the field, and it isn't known who has struck him; 
verse:21:2 then your elders and your judges shall come forth, and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is slain: 
verse:21:3 and it shall be, that the city which is nearest to the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hasn't been worked with, and which has not drawn in the yoke; 
verse:21:4 and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley. 
verse:21:5 The priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them HASHEM your God has chosen to minister to him, and to bless in the name of HASHEM; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be. 
verse:21:6 All the elders of that city, who are nearest to the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley; 
verse:21:7 and they shall answer and say, "Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it. 
verse:21:8 Forgive, HASHEM, your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and don't allow innocent blood in the midst of your people Israel." The blood shall be forgiven them. 
verse:21:9 So you shall put away the innocent blood from the midst of you, when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of HASHEM.
portion:Deuteronomy 21:7 - 21:9
verse:21:7 and they shall answer and say, "Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.

portion:Deuteronomy 21:10 - 21:21
verse:21:10 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and HASHEM your God delivers them into your hands, and you carry them away captive, 
verse:21:11 and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you have a desire to her, and would take her to you as wife; 
verse:21:12 then you shall bring her home to your house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; 
verse:21:13 and she shall put the clothing of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in your house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that you shall go in to her, and be her husband, and she shall be your wife. 
verse:21:14 It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go where she will; but you shall not sell her at all for money, you shall not deal with her as a slave, because you have humbled her. 
verse:21:15 If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers who was hated; 
verse:21:16 then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn: 
verse:21:17 but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his. 
verse:21:18 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not listen to them; 
verse:21:19 then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate of his place; 
verse:21:20 and they shall tell the elders of his city, "This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard." 
verse:21:21 All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones: so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
portion:Deuteronomy 21:22 - 22:7
verse:21:22 If a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and you hang him on a tree; 
verse:21:23 his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall surely bury him the same day; for he who is hanged is accursed of God; that you don't defile your land which HASHEM your God gives you for an inheritance.
verse:22:1 You shall not see your brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide yourself from them: you shall surely bring them again to your brother. 
verse:22:2 If your brother isn't near to you, or if you don't know him, then you shall bring it home to your house, and it shall be with you until your brother seek after it, and you shall restore it to him. 
verse:22:3 So you shall do with his donkey; and so you shall do with his garment; and so you shall do with every lost thing of your brother's, which he has lost, and you have found: you may not hide yourself. 
verse:22:4 You shall not see your brother's donkey or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them: you shall surely help him to lift them up again. 
verse:22:5 A woman shall not wear men's clothing, neither shall a man put on women's clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to HASHEM your God. 
verse:22:6 If a bird's nest chance to be before you in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall not take the hen with the young:

verse:22:12 You shall make yourselves tzitzit on the four borders of your cloak, with which you cover yourself.
verse:22:13 If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, and hates her, 
verse:22:14 and accuses her of shameful things, and brings up an evil name on her, and says, "I took this woman, and when I came near to her, I didn't find in her the tokens of virginity;" 
verse:22:15 then shall the father of the young lady, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the young lady's virginity to the elders of the city in the gate; 
verse:22:16 and the young lady's father shall tell the elders, "I gave my daughter to this man to wife, and he hates her; 
verse:22:17 and behold, he has accused her of shameful things, saying, 'I didn't find in your daughter the tokens of virginity;' and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity." They shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city. 
verse:22:18 The elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him; 
verse:22:19 and they shall fine him one hundred shekels of silver, and give them to the father of the young lady, because he has brought up an evil name on a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.
verse:22:20 But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the young lady; 
verse:22:21 then they shall bring out the young lady to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done folly in Israel, to play the prostitute in her father's house: so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you. 
verse:22:22 If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, the man who lay with the woman, and the woman: so you shall put away the evil from Israel.

verse:22:24 then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones; the lady, because she didn't cry, being in the city; and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor's wife: so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you. 
verse:22:25 But if the man find the lady who is pledged to be married in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her; then the man only who lay with her shall die: 
verse:22:26 but to the lady you shall do nothing; there is in the lady no sin worthy of death: for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and kills him, even so is this matter; 
verse:22:27 for he found her in the field, the pledged to be married lady cried, and there was none to save her. 
verse:22:28 If a man find a lady who is a virgin, who is not pledged to be married, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; 
verse:22:29 then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he has humbled her; he may not put her away all his days.

verse:23:4 An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of HASHEM; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging to them enter into the assembly of HASHEM forever: 
verse:23:5 because they didn't meet you with bread and with water in the way, when you came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you. 
verse:23:6 Nevertheless HASHEM your God wouldn't listen to Balaam; but HASHEM your God turned the curse into a blessing to you, because HASHEM your God loved you. 
verse:23:7 You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days forever.
portion:Deuteronomy 23:8 - 23:24
verse:23:8 You shall not abhor an Edomite; for he is your brother: you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you lived as a foreigner in his land. 
verse:23:9 The children of the third generation who are born to them shall enter into the assembly of HASHEM. 
verse:23:10 When you go forth in camp against your enemies, then you shall keep yourselves from every evil thing.

verse:23:13 You shall have a place also outside of the camp, where you shall go forth abroad: 
verse:23:14 and you shall have a paddle among your weapons; and it shall be, when you sit down abroad, you shall dig therewith, and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you: 
verse:23:15 for HASHEM your God walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you; therefore your camp shall be holy, that he may not see an unclean thing in you, and turn away from you. 
verse:23:16 You shall not deliver to his master a servant who is escaped from his master to you: 
verse:23:17 he shall dwell with you, in the midst of you, in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates, where it pleases him best: you shall not oppress him. 
verse:23:18 There shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel. 
verse:23:19 You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute, or the wages of a dog, into the house of HASHEM your God for any vow: for even both these are an abomination to HASHEM your God. 
verse:23:20 You shall not lend on interest to your brother; interest of money, interest of food, interest of anything that is lent on interest: 
verse:23:21 to a foreigner you may lend on interest; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest, that HASHEM your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to, in the land where you go in to possess it. 
verse:23:22 When you shall vow a vow to HASHEM your God, you shall not be slack to pay it: for HASHEM your God will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you. 
verse:23:23 But if you shall forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in you. 
verse:23:24 That which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; according as you have vowed to HASHEM your God, a freewill offering, which you have promised with your mouth.

verse:24:2 When she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife. 
verse:24:3 If the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife; 
verse:24:4 her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before HASHEM: and you shall not cause the land to sin, which HASHEM your God gives you for an inheritance.
portion:Deuteronomy 24:5 - 24:13

portion:Deuteronomy 24:14 - 25:19
verse:24:14 You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he be of your brothers, or of your foreigners who are in your land within your gates: 
verse:24:15 in his day you shall give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down on it; for he is poor, and sets his heart on it: lest he cry against you to HASHEM, and it be sin to you. 
verse:24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin. 
verse:24:17 You shall not deprive the foreigner, or the fatherless of justice, nor take a widow's clothing in pledge; 
verse:24:18 but you shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt, and HASHEM your God redeemed you there: therefore I command you to do this thing. 
verse:24:19 When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgot a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to get it: it shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that HASHEM your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.

verse:25:3 Forty stripes he may give him, he shall not exceed; lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then your brother should seem vile to you. 
verse:25:4 You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out the grain.

verse:31:3 HASHEM your God, he will go over before you; he will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua shall go over before you, as HASHEM has spoken.
portion:Deuteronomy 31:4 - 31:6
verse:31:4 HASHEM will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land; whom he destroyed.

verse:31:8 HASHEM, he it is who does go before you; he will be with you, he will not fail you, neither forsake you: don't be afraid, neither be dismayed."
verse:31:9 Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of HASHEM, and to all the elders of Israel. 
portion:Deuteronomy 31:10 - 31:13
verse:31:10 Moses commanded them, saying, "At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of booths, 
verse:31:11 when all Israel has come to appear before HASHEM your God in the place which he shall choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing. 
verse:31:12 Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and your foreigner who is within your gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear HASHEM your God, and observe to do all the words of this law; 
verse:31:13 and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and learn to fear HASHEM your God, as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it."
portion:Deuteronomy 31:14 - 31:19
verse:31:14 HASHEM said to Moses, "Behold, your days approach that you must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, that I may commission him." Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting.
verse:31:15 HASHEM appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent. 
verse:31:16 HASHEM said to Moses, "Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and play the prostitute after the strange gods of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them. 
verse:31:17 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come on them; so that they will say in that day, 'Haven't these evils come on us because our God is not among us?' 
verse:31:18 I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have worked, in that they are turned to other gods.
verse:31:19 "Now therefore write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
portion:Deuteronomy 31:20 - 31:24
verse:31:20 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant. 
verse:31:21 It shall happen, when many evils and troubles have come on them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I swore." 
verse:31:22 So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
verse:31:23 He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, "Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with you."
verse:31:24 It happened, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
portion:Deuteronomy 31:25 - 31:30
verse:31:25 that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of HASHEM, saying, 
verse:31:26 "Take this scroll of the Torah, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of HASHEM your God, that it may be there for a witness against you. 
verse:31:27 For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against HASHEM; and how much more after my death? 
verse:31:28 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them. 
verse:31:29 For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days; because you will do that which is evil in the sight of HASHEM, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands."
verse:31:30 Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.
portion:Deuteronomy 31:28 - 31:30
verse:31:28 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them. 
verse:31:29 For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days; because you will do that which is evil in the sight of HASHEM, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands."
verse:31:30 Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished. 
portion:Deuteronomy 32:1 - 32:6
verse:32:1 Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak. Let the earth hear the words of my mouth. 
verse:32:2 My doctrine shall drop as the rain. My speech shall condense as the dew, as the small rain on the tender grass, as the showers on the herb. 
verse:32:3 For I will proclaim the name of HASHEM. Ascribe greatness to our God! 
verse:32:4 The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are justice: a God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is he. 
verse:32:5 They have dealt corruptly with him. They are not his children,  because of their defect. They are a perverse and crooked generation. 
verse:32:6 Do you thus requite HASHEM, foolish people and unwise? Isn't he your father who has bought you? He has made you, and established you.
portion:Deuteronomy 32:7 - 32:12
verse:32:7 Remember the days of old. Consider the years of many generations. Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you. 
verse:32:8 When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the children of men, he set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel. 
verse:32:9 For HASHEM's portion is his people. Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. 
verse:32:10 He found him in a desert land, in the waste howling wilderness. He surrounded him. He cared for him. He kept him as the apple of his eye. 
verse:32:11 As an eagle that stirs up her nest, that flutters over her young, he spread abroad his wings, he took them, he bore them on his feathers. 
verse:32:12 HASHEM alone led him. There was no foreign god with him.
portion:Deuteronomy 32:13 - 32:18
verse:32:13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth. He ate the increase of the field. He caused him to suck honey out of the rock, oil out of the flinty rock; 
verse:32:14 Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the finest of the wheat. Of the blood of the grape you drank wine. 
verse:32:15 But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked. You have grown fat. You have grown thick. You have become sleek. Then he forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation. 
verse:32:16 They moved him to jealousy with strange gods. They provoked him to anger with abominations. 
verse:32:17 They sacrificed to demons, not God, to gods that they didn't know, to new gods that came up recently, which your fathers didn't dread. 
verse:32:18 Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful, and have forgotten God who gave you birth.
portion:Deuteronomy 32:19 - 32:28
verse:32:19 HASHEM saw and abhorred, because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters. 
verse:32:20 He said, "I will hide my face from them. I will see what their end shall be; for they are a very perverse generation, children in whom is no faithfulness. 
verse:32:21 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God. They have provoked me to anger with their vanities. I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people. I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. 
verse:32:22 For a fire is kindled in my anger, Burns to the lowest Sheol, Devours the earth with its increase, and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire.  
verse:32:23 "I will heap evils on them. I will spend my arrows on them. 
verse:32:24 They shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat and bitter destruction. I will send the teeth of animals on them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust. 
verse:32:25 Outside the sword shall bereave, and in the rooms, terror; on both young man and virgin, The nursing infant with the gray-haired man. 
verse:32:26 I said, I would scatter them afar. I would make their memory to cease from among men; 
verse:32:27 were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, lest their adversaries should judge wrongly, lest they should say, 'Our hand is exalted, HASHEM has not done all this.'"  
verse:32:28 For they are a nation void of counsel. There is no understanding in them.
portion:Deuteronomy 32:29 - 32:39
verse:32:29 Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end! 
verse:32:30 How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and HASHEM had delivered them up? 
verse:32:31 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges. 
verse:32:32 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, of the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter. 
verse:32:33 Their wine is the poison of serpents, The cruel venom of asps.  
verse:32:34 "Isn't this laid up in store with me, sealed up among my treasures? 
verse:32:35 Vengeance is mine, and recompense, at the time when their foot slides; for the day of their calamity is at hand. The things that are to come on them shall make haste."  
verse:32:36 For HASHEM will judge his people, and have compassion on his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, There is none remaining, shut up or left at large. 
verse:32:37 He will say, "Where are their gods, The rock in which they took refuge; 
verse:32:38 Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you! Let them be your protection.  
verse:32:39 "See now that I, even I, am he, There is no god with me. I kill, and I make alive. I wound, and I heal. There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.
portion:Deuteronomy 32:40 - 32:43
verse:32:40 For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live forever, 
verse:32:41 if I whet my glittering sword, My hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my adversaries, and will recompense those who hate me. 
verse:32:42 I will make my arrows drunk with blood. My sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the  captives, from the head of the leaders of the enemy."  
verse:32:43 Rejoice, you nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants. He will render vengeance to his adversaries, And will make expiation for his land, for his people.
portion:Deuteronomy 32:44 - 32:52
verse:32:44 Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun. 
verse:32:45 Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel; 
verse:32:46 He said to them, "Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you this day, which you shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law. 
verse:32:47 For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it."
verse:32:48 HASHEM spoke to Moses that same day, saying, 
verse:32:49 "Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession; 
verse:32:50 and die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people: 
verse:32:51 because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn't sanctify me in the midst of the children of Israel. 
verse:32:52 For you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel."

verse:33:2 He said, "HASHEM came from Sinai, And rose from Seir to them. He shone forth from Mount Paran. He came from the ten thousands of holy ones. At his right hand was a fiery law for them. 
verse:33:3 Yes, he loves the people. All his holy ones are in your hand. They sat down at your feet; each receives your words. 
verse:33:4 Moses commanded us a law, An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob. 
verse:33:5 He was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered, All the tribes of Israel together.  
verse:33:6 "Let Reuben live, and not die; Nor let his men be few."
verse:33:7 This is for Judah. He said, "Hear, HASHEM, the voice of Judah. Bring him in to his people. With his hands he contended for himself. You shall be a help against his adversaries."
portion:Deuteronomy 33:8 - 33:12
verse:33:8 Of Levi he said, "Your Thummim and your Urim are with your godly one, whom you proved at Massah, with whom you strove at the waters of Meribah; 
verse:33:9 who said of his father, and of his mother, 'I have not seen him;' Neither did he acknowledge his brothers, Nor did he know his own children: For they have observed your word, and keep your covenant. 
verse:33:10 They shall teach Jacob your ordinances, and Israel your law. They shall put incense before you, and whole burnt offering on your altar. 
verse:33:11 HASHEM, bless his substance. Accept the work of his hands. Strike through the hips of those who rise up against him, of those who hate him, that they not rise again."
verse:33:12 Of Benjamin he said, "The beloved of HASHEM shall dwell in safety by him. He covers him all the day long. He dwells between his shoulders."

verse:33:14 for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, for the precious things of the growth of the moons, 
verse:33:15 for the chief things of the ancient mountains, for the precious things of the everlasting hills, 
verse:33:16 for the precious things of the earth and its fullness, the good will of him who lived in the bush. Let this come on the head of Joseph, on the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers. 
verse:33:17 The firstborn of his herd, majesty is his. His horns are the horns of the wild ox. With them he shall push all of the peoples, to the ends of the earth: They are the ten thousands of Ephraim. They are the thousands of Manasseh."

verse:33:18 Of Zebulun he said, "Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and Issachar, in your tents. 
verse:33:19 They shall call the peoples to the mountain. There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness, for they shall draw out the abundance of the seas, the hidden treasures of the sand."
verse:33:20 Of Gad he said, "He who enlarges Gad is blessed. He dwells as a lioness, and tears the arm, yes, the crown of the head. 
verse:33:21 He provided the first part for himself, for there was the lawgiver's portion reserved. He came with the heads of the people. He executed the righteousness of HASHEM, His ordinances with Israel."

verse:33:23 Of Naphtali he said, "Naphtali, satisfied with favor, full of the blessing of HASHEM, Possess the west and the south."
verse:33:24 Of Asher he said, "Asher is blessed with children. Let him be acceptable to his brothers. Let him dip his foot in oil. 
verse:33:25 Your bars shall be iron and brass. As your days, so your strength will be.

verse:33:29 You are happy, Israel. Who is like you, a people saved by HASHEM, the shield of your help, the sword of your excellency! Your enemies shall submit themselves to you. You shall tread on their high places."
verse:34:1 Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. HASHEM showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan, 
verse:34:2 and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the hinder sea, 
verse:34:3 and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, to Zoar. 
verse:34:4 HASHEM said to him, "This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your seed.' I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there."
verse:34:5 So Moses the servant of HASHEM died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of HASHEM. 
verse:34:6 He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth Peor: but no man knows of his tomb to this day. 
verse:34:7 Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.

verse:34:9 Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands on him: and the children of Israel listened to him, and did as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:34:10 There has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom HASHEM knew face to face, 
verse:34:11 in all the signs and the wonders, which HASHEM sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, 
verse:34:12 and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses worked in the sight of all Israel.

verse:35:20 All the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 
verse:35:21 They came, everyone whose heart stirred him up, and everyone whom his spirit made willing, and brought HASHEM's offering, for the work of the Tent of Meeting, and for all of its service, and for the holy garments. 
verse:35:22 They came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, and brought brooches, earrings, signet rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold; even every man who offered an offering of gold to HASHEM. 
verse:35:23 Everyone, with whom was found blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats' hair, rams' skins dyed red, and sea cow hides, brought them. 
verse:35:24 Everyone who offered an offering of silver and brass brought HASHEM's offering; and everyone, with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it.

portion:Exodus 35:30 - 37:16
verse:35:30 Moses said to the children of Israel, "Behold, HASHEM has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 
verse:35:31 He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship; 
verse:35:32 and to make skillful works, to work in gold, in silver, in brass, 
verse:35:33 in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of skillful workmanship. 
verse:35:34 He has put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 
verse:35:35 He has filled them with wisdom of heart, to work all kinds of workmanship, of the engraver, of the skillful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of those who do any workmanship, and of those who make skillful works.
verse:36:1 "Bezalel and Oholiab shall work with every wise-hearted man, in whom HASHEM has put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that HASHEM has commanded."
verse:36:2 Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart HASHEM had put wisdom, even everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to the work to do it: 
verse:36:3 and they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, with which to make it. They brought yet to him freewill offerings every morning. 
verse:36:4 All the wise men, who performed all the work of the sanctuary, each came from his work which they did. 
verse:36:5 They spoke to Moses, saying, "The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which HASHEM commanded to make."
verse:36:6 Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, "Let neither man nor woman make anything else for the offering for the sanctuary." So the people were restrained from bringing. 
verse:36:7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
verse:36:8 All the wise-hearted men among those who did the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, blue, purple, and scarlet, with cherubim, the work of the skillful workman, they made them. 
verse:36:9 The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. All the curtains had one measure. 
verse:36:10 He coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled one to another. 
verse:36:11 He made loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain from the edge in the coupling. Likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling. 
verse:36:12 He made fifty loops in the one curtain, and he made fifty loops in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling. The loops were opposite one to another. 
verse:36:13 He made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps: so the tabernacle was a unit.
verse:36:14 He made curtains of goats' hair for a covering over the tabernacle. He made them eleven curtains. 
verse:36:15 The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the breadth of each curtain. The eleven curtains had one measure. 
verse:36:16 He coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.

verse:38:1 He made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood. It was square. Its length was five cubits, its breadth was five cubits, and its height was three cubits.

verse:38:3 He made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, the shovels, the basins, the forks, and the fire pans. He made all its vessels of brass. 
verse:38:4 He made for the altar a grating of a network of brass, under the ledge around it beneath, reaching halfway up.

verse:38:6 He made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with brass. 
verse:38:7 He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it. He made it hollow with planks.
verse:38:8 He made the basin of brass, and its base of brass, out of the mirrors of the ministering women who ministered at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
verse:38:9 He made the court: for the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, one hundred cubits; 
verse:38:10 their pillars were twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver. 
verse:38:11 For the north side one hundred cubits, their pillars twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver. 
verse:38:12 For the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver. 
verse:38:13 For the east side eastward fifty cubits. 
verse:38:14 The hangings for the one side were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three; 
verse:38:15 and so for the other side: on this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. 
verse:38:16 All the hangings around the court were of fine twined linen. 
verse:38:17 The sockets for the pillars were of brass. The hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver; and the overlaying of their capitals, of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver. 
verse:38:18 The screen for the gate of the court was the work of the embroiderer, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen. Twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, like to the hangings of the court. 
verse:38:19 Their pillars were four, and their sockets four, of brass; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals, and their fillets, of silver. 
verse:38:20 All the pins of the tabernacle, and around the court, were of brass.
verse:38:21 This is the amount of material used for the tabernacle, even the Tabernacle of the Testimony, as they were counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest. 
verse:38:22 Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:38:23 With him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a skillful workman, and an embroiderer in blue, in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen.
verse:38:24 All the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the offering, was twenty-nine talents, and seven hundred thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 
verse:38:25 The silver of those who were numbered of the congregation was one hundred talents, and one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 
verse:38:26 a beka a head, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for everyone who passed over to those who were numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty men. 
verse:38:27 The one hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the veil; one hundred sockets for the one hundred talents, a talent for a socket. 
verse:38:28 Of the one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, overlaid their capitals, and made fillets for them. 
verse:38:29 The brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand four hundred shekels. 
verse:38:30 With this he made the sockets to the door of the Tent of Meeting, the bronze altar, the bronze grating for it, all the vessels of the altar, 
verse:38:31 the sockets around the court, the sockets of the gate of the court, all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins around the court.
verse:39:1 Of the blue, purple, and scarlet, they made finely worked garments, for ministering in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as HASHEM commanded Moses.
portion:Exodus 39:22 - 39:43
verse:39:22 He made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue. 
verse:39:23 The opening of the robe in its midst was like the opening of a coat of mail, with a binding around its opening, that it should not be torn. 
verse:39:24 They made on the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, purple, scarlet, and twined linen. 
verse:39:25 They made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates around the skirts of the robe, between the pomegranates; 
verse:39:26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, around the skirts of the robe, to minister in, as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:39:27 They made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons, 
verse:39:28 and the turban of fine linen, and the linen headbands of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen, 
verse:39:29 and the sash of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the embroiderer, as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:39:30 They made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote on it a writing, like the engravings of a signet: "HOLY TO THE HASHEM." 
verse:39:31 They tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it on the turban above, as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:39:32 Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting was finished. The children of Israel did according to all that HASHEM commanded Moses; so they did. 
verse:39:33 They brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent, with all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, its sockets,

verse:39:41 the finely worked garments for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office. 
verse:39:42 According to all that HASHEM commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work. 
verse:39:43 Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it as HASHEM had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.
portion:Exodus 40:1 - 40:38
verse:40:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:40:2 "On the first day of the first month you shall raise up the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:40:3 You shall put the ark of the testimony in it, and you shall screen the ark with the veil. 
verse:40:4 You shall bring in the table, and set in order the things that are on it. You shall bring in the menorah, and light its lamps. 
verse:40:5 You shall set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.
verse:40:6 "You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:40:7 You shall set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and shall put water therein. 
verse:40:8 You shall set up the court around it, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court.
verse:40:9 "You shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is in it, and shall make it holy, and all its furniture: and it will be holy. 
verse:40:10 You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar will be most holy. 
verse:40:11 You shall anoint the basin and its base, and sanctify it.
verse:40:12 "You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and shall wash them with water. 
verse:40:13 You shall put on Aaron the holy garments; and you shall anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister to me in the priest's office. 
verse:40:14 You shall bring his sons, and put coats on them. 
verse:40:15 You shall anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may minister to me in the priest's office. Their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations." 
verse:40:16 Moses did so. According to all that HASHEM commanded him, so he did.
verse:40:17 It happened in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was raised up. 
verse:40:18 Moses raised up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and raised up its pillars. 
verse:40:19 He spread the covering over the tent, and put the roof of the tabernacle above on it, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:20 He took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the poles on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark. 
verse:40:21 He brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:22 He put the table in the Tent of Meeting, on the side of the tabernacle northward, outside of the veil. 
verse:40:23 He set the bread in order on it before HASHEM, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:24 He put the menorah in the Tent of Meeting, opposite the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. 
verse:40:25 He lit the lamps before HASHEM, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:26 He put the golden altar in the Tent of Meeting before the veil; 
verse:40:27 and he burnt incense of sweet spices on it, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:28 He put up the screen of the door to the tabernacle. 
verse:40:29 He set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:30 He set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water therein, with which to wash. 
verse:40:31 Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and their feet there. 
verse:40:32 When they went into the Tent of Meeting, and when they came near to the altar, they washed, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:33 He raised up the court around the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.
verse:40:34 Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of HASHEM filled the tabernacle. 
verse:40:35 Moses wasn't able to enter into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud stayed on it, and HASHEM's glory filled the tabernacle. 
verse:40:36 When the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys; 
verse:40:37 but if the cloud wasn't taken up, then they didn't travel until the day that it was taken up. 
verse:40:38 For the cloud of HASHEM was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.

verse:12:7 and he shall offer it before HASHEM, and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood.
"'This is the law for her who bears, whether a male or a female.

verse:13:2 "When a man shall have a rising in his body's skin, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it becomes in the skin of his body the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons, the priests: 
verse:13:3 and the priest shall examine the plague in the skin of the body: and if the hair in the plague has turned white, and the appearance of the plague is deeper than the body's skin, it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall examine him, and pronounce him unclean. 
verse:13:4 If the bright spot is white in the skin of his body, and its appearance isn't deeper than the skin, and its hair hasn't turned white, then the priest shall isolate the infected person for seven days.

verse:13:7 But if the scab spreads on the skin, after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again. 
verse:13:8 The priest shall examine him; and behold, if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is leprosy.
verse:13:9 "When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest; 
verse:13:10 and the priest shall examine him. Behold, if there is a white rising in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the rising, 
verse:13:11 it is a chronic leprosy in the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. He shall not isolate him, for he is unclean.

verse:13:21 But if the priest examines it, and behold, there are no white hairs in it, and it isn't deeper than the skin, but is dim, then the priest shall isolate him seven days. 
verse:13:22 If it spreads in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a plague.

verse:14:35 then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, 'There seems to me to be some sort of plague in the house.' 
verse:14:36 The priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest goes in to examine the plague, that all that is in the house not be made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to inspect the house. 
verse:14:37 He shall examine the plague; and behold, if the plague is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and it appears to be deeper than the wall; 
verse:14:38 then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days. 
verse:14:39 The priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look. If the plague has spread in the walls of the house, 
verse:14:40 then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the plague, and cast them into an unclean place outside of the city: 
verse:14:41 and he shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped all over, and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scraped off, outside of the city into an unclean place. 
verse:14:42 They shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.

verse:13:3 and the priest shall examine the plague in the skin of the body: and if the hair in the plague has turned white, and the appearance of the plague is deeper than the body's skin, it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall examine him, and pronounce him unclean. 
verse:13:4 If the bright spot is white in the skin of his body, and its appearance isn't deeper than the skin, and its hair hasn't turned white, then the priest shall isolate the infected person for seven days.

verse:13:7 But if the scab spreads on the skin, after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again. 
verse:13:8 The priest shall examine him; and behold, if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is leprosy.
verse:13:9 "When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest; 
verse:13:10 and the priest shall examine him. Behold, if there is a white rising in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the rising, 
verse:13:11 it is a chronic leprosy in the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. He shall not isolate him, for he is unclean.
verse:13:12 "If the leprosy breaks out all over the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of the infected person from his head even to his feet, as far as it appears to the priest; 
verse:13:13 then the priest shall examine him; and, behold, if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean of the plague. It has all turned white: he is clean.

verse:13:30 then the priest shall examine the plague; and behold, if its appearance is deeper than the skin, and the hair in it is yellow and thin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is an itch, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard. 
verse:13:31 If the priest examines the plague of itching, and behold, its appearance isn't deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall isolate him the person infected with itching seven days. 
verse:13:32 On the seventh day the priest shall examine the plague; and behold, if the itch hasn't spread, and there is no yellow hair in it, and the appearance of the itch isn't deeper than the skin, 
verse:13:33 then he shall be shaved, but he shall not shave the itch; and the priest shall shut him up who has the itch seven more days.

verse:13:35 But if the itch spreads in the skin after his cleansing, 
verse:13:36 then the priest shall examine him; and behold, if the itch has spread in the skin, the priest shall not look for the yellow hair; he is unclean. 
verse:13:37 But if in his eyes the itch is arrested, and black hair has grown in it; the itch is healed, he is clean. The priest shall pronounce him clean.
verse:13:38 "When a man or a woman has bright spots in the skin of the body, even white bright spots;

verse:13:41 If his hair has fallen off from the front part of his head, he is forehead bald. He is clean. 
verse:13:42 But if there is in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague; it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead. 
verse:13:43 Then the priest shall examine him; and, behold, if the rising of the plague is reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh, 
verse:13:44 he is a leprous man. He is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce him unclean. His plague is on his head.
verse:13:45 "The leper in whom the plague is shall wear torn clothes, and the hair of his head shall hang loose. He shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry, 'Unclean! Unclean!' 
verse:13:46 All the days in which the plague is in him he shall be unclean. He is unclean. He shall dwell alone. Outside of the camp shall be his dwelling.
verse:13:47 "The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it is a woolen garment, or a linen garment; 
verse:13:48 whether it is in warp, or woof; of linen, or of wool; whether in a skin, or in anything made of skin; 
verse:13:49 if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything made of skin; it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be shown to the priest. 
verse:13:50 The priest shall examine the plague, and isolate the plague seven days. 
verse:13:51 He shall examine the plague on the seventh day. If the plague has spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever use the skin is used for, the plague is a destructive mildew. It is unclean. 
verse:13:52 He shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in wool or in linen, or anything of skin, in which the plague is: for it is a destructive mildew. It shall be burned in the fire.
verse:13:53 "If the priest examines it, and behold, the plague hasn't spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin; 
verse:13:54 then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which the plague is, and he shall isolate it seven more days. 
verse:13:55 Then the priest shall examine it, after the plague is washed; and behold, if the plague hasn't changed its color, and the plague hasn't spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire. It is a mildewed spot, whether the bareness is inside or outside. 
verse:13:56 If the priest looks, and behold, the plague has faded after it is washed, then he shall tear it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: 
verse:13:57 and if it appears again in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is spreading. You shall burn with fire that in which the plague is. 
verse:13:58 The garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatever thing of skin it is, which you shall wash, if the plague has departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and it will be clean."
verse:13:59 This is the law of the plague of mildew in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or in anything of skin, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
verse:14:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying,
verse:14:2 "This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing. He shall be brought to the priest, 
verse:14:3 and the priest shall go forth out of the camp. The priest shall examine him, and behold, if the plague of leprosy is healed in the leper, 
verse:14:4 then the priest shall command them to take for him who is to be cleansed two living clean birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. 
verse:14:5 The priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water. 
verse:14:6 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water. 
verse:14:7 He shall sprinkle on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird go into the open field.
verse:14:8 "He who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water; and he shall be clean. After that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days. 
verse:14:9 It shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off. He shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his body in water, then he shall be clean.
verse:14:10 "On the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish, and three tenths of an efah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil. 
verse:14:11 The priest who cleanses him shall set the man who is to be cleansed, and those things, before HASHEM, at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
verse:14:12 "The priest shall take one of the male lambs, and offer him for a trespass offering, with the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before HASHEM. 
verse:14:13 He shall kill the male lamb in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the sanctuary; for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering. It is most holy. 
verse:14:14 The priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. 
verse:14:15 The priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand.

verse:14:17 The priest shall put some of the rest of the oil that is in his hand on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering. 
verse:14:18 The rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed, and the priest shall make atonement for him before HASHEM.
verse:14:19 "The priest shall offer the sin offering, and make atonement for him who is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness: and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering; 
verse:14:20 and the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meal offering on the altar. The priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
verse:14:21 "If he is poor, and can't afford so much, then he shall take one male lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one tenth of an efah of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal offering, and a log of oil; 
verse:14:22 and two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to afford; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering.
verse:14:23 "On the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest, to the door of the Tent of Meeting, before HASHEM. 
verse:14:24 The priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before HASHEM. 
verse:14:25 He shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering. The priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering and put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. 
verse:14:26 The priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand; 
verse:14:27 and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before HASHEM. 
verse:14:28 Then the priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the trespass offering. 
verse:14:29 The rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before HASHEM. 
verse:14:30 He shall offer one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as he is able to afford, 
verse:14:31 even such as he is able to afford, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the meal offering. The priest shall make atonement for him who is to be cleansed before HASHEM."
verse:14:32 This is the law for him in whom is the plague of leprosy, who is not able to afford the sacrifice for his cleansing.
verse:14:33 HASHEM spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
verse:14:34 "When you have come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put a spreading mildew in a house in the land of your possession, 
verse:14:35 then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, 'There seems to me to be some sort of plague in the house.' 
verse:14:36 The priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest goes in to examine the plague, that all that is in the house not be made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to inspect the house. 
verse:14:37 He shall examine the plague; and behold, if the plague is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and it appears to be deeper than the wall; 
verse:14:38 then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days. 
verse:14:39 The priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look. If the plague has spread in the walls of the house, 
verse:14:40 then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the plague, and cast them into an unclean place outside of the city: 
verse:14:41 and he shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped all over, and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scraped off, outside of the city into an unclean place. 
verse:14:42 They shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.
verse:14:43 "If the plague comes again, and breaks out in the house, after he has taken out the stones, and after he has scraped the house, and after it was plastered; 
verse:14:44 then the priest shall come in and look; and behold, if the plague has spread in the house, it is a destructive mildew in the house. It is unclean. 
verse:14:45 He shall break down the house, its stones, and its timber, and all the house's mortar. He shall carry them out of the city into an unclean place.
verse:14:46 "Moreover he who goes into the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening. 
verse:14:47 He who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes; and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.
verse:14:48 "If the priest shall come in, and examine it, and behold, the plague hasn't spread in the house, after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed. 
verse:14:49 To cleanse the house he shall take two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. 
verse:14:50 He shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water. 
verse:14:51 He shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times. 
verse:14:52 He shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, with the living bird, with the cedar wood, with the hyssop, and with the scarlet; 
verse:14:53 but he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field. So shall he make atonement for the house; and it shall be clean."
verse:14:54 This is the law for any plague of leprosy, and for an itch, 
verse:14:55 and for the destructive mildew of a garment, and for a house, 
verse:14:56 and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot; 
verse:14:57 to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean.
 This is the law of leprosy.
verse:15:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
verse:15:2 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When any man has a discharge from his body, because of his discharge he is unclean.

verse:25:29 "'If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it has been sold. For a full year he shall have the right of redemption. 
verse:25:30 If it isn't redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations. It shall not be released in the Jubilee. 
verse:25:31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall around them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the Jubilee.
verse:25:32 "'Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses in the cities of their possession, the Levites may redeem at any time. 
verse:25:33 The Levites may redeem the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, and it shall be released in the Jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel. 
verse:25:34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
verse:25:35 "'If your brother has become poor, and his hand can't support him among you; then you shall uphold him. He shall live with you like an alien and a temporary resident. 
verse:25:36 Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God; that your brother may live among you. 
verse:25:37 You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit. 
verse:25:38 I am HASHEM your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.
verse:25:39 "'If your brother has grown poor among you, and sells himself to you; you shall not make him to serve as a slave. 
verse:25:40 As a hired servant, and as a temporary resident, he shall be with you; he shall serve with you until the Year of Jubilee: 
verse:25:41 then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and shall return to his own family, and to the possession of his fathers. 
verse:25:42 For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. They shall not be sold as slaves. 
verse:25:43 You shall not rule over him with harshness, but shall fear your God.
verse:25:44 "'As for your male and your female slaves, whom you may have; of the nations that are around you, from them you may buy male and female slaves. 
verse:25:45 Moreover of the children of the aliens who live among you, of them you may buy, and of their families who are with you, which they have conceived in your land; and they will be your property. 
verse:25:46 You may make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them may you take your slaves forever: but over your brothers the children of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, with harshness.
verse:25:47 "'If an alien or temporary resident with you becomes rich, and your brother beside him has grown poor, and sells himself to the stranger or foreigner living among you, or to a member of the stranger's family; 
verse:25:48 after he is sold he may be redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him; 
verse:25:49 or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any who is a close relative to him of his family may redeem him; or if he has grown rich, he may redeem himself. 
verse:25:50 He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the Year of Jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him. 
verse:25:51 If there are yet many years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for. 
verse:25:52 If there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according to his years of service he shall give back the price of his redemption. 
verse:25:53 As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with harshness over him in your sight. 
verse:25:54 If he isn't redeemed by these means, then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee, he, and his children with him. 
verse:25:55 For to me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. I am HASHEM your God.
verse:26:1 "'You shall make for yourselves no idols, neither shall you raise up an engraved image or a pillar, neither shall you place any figured stone in your land, to bow down to it: for I am HASHEM your God.
verse:26:2 "'You shall keep my Sabbaths, and have reverence for my sanctuary. I am HASHEM.
verse:26:3 "'If you walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; 
verse:26:4 then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. 
verse:26:5 Your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time; and you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
verse:26:6 "'I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and no one will make you afraid; and I will remove evil animals out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. 
verse:26:7 You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. 
verse:26:8 Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
verse:26:9 "'I will have respect for you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you. 
verse:26:10 You shall eat old store long kept, and you shall move out the old because of the new. 
verse:26:11 I will set my tent among you: and my soul won't abhor you. 
verse:26:12 I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you will be my people. 
verse:26:13 I am HASHEM your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.
verse:26:14 "'But if you will not listen to me, and will not do all these commandments; 
verse:26:15 and if you shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhors my ordinances, so that you will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant; 
verse:26:16 I also will do this to you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and you will sow your seed in vain, for your enemies will eat it. 
verse:26:17 I will set my face against you, and you will be struck before your enemies. Those who hate you will rule over you; and you will flee when no one pursues you.
verse:26:18 "'If you in spite of these things will not listen to me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins. 
verse:26:19 I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your sky like iron, and your soil like brass; 
verse:26:20 and your strength will be spent in vain; for your land won't yield its increase, neither will the trees of the land yield their fruit.
verse:26:21 "'If you walk contrary to me, and won't listen to me, then I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins. 
verse:26:22 I will send the wild animals among you, which will rob you of your children, destroy your livestock, and make you few in number; and your roads will become desolate.
verse:26:23 "'If by these things you won't be reformed to me, but will walk contrary to me; 
verse:26:24 then I will also walk contrary to you; and I will strike you, even I, seven times for your sins. 
verse:26:25 I will bring a sword upon you, that will execute the vengeance of the covenant; and you will be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and you will be delivered into the hand of the enemy. 
verse:26:26 When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and you shall eat, and not be satisfied.
verse:26:27 "'If you in spite of this won't listen to me, but walk contrary to me; 
verse:26:28 then I will walk contrary to you in wrath; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins. 
verse:26:29 You will eat the flesh of your sons, and you will eat the flesh of your daughters. 
verse:26:30 I will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul will abhor you. 
verse:26:31 I will lay your cities waste, and will bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not take delight in the sweet fragrance of your offerings. 
verse:26:32 I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein will be astonished at it. 
verse:26:33 I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land will be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste. 
verse:26:34 Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in your enemies' land. Even then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths. 
verse:26:35 As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it didn't have in your sabbaths, when you lived on it.
verse:26:36 "'As for those of you who are left, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf will put them to flight; and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword; and they will fall when no one pursues. 
verse:26:37 They will stumble over one another, as it were before the sword, when no one pursues: and you will have no power to stand before your enemies. 
verse:26:38 You will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies will eat you up. 
verse:26:39 Those of you who are left will pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
verse:26:40 "'If they confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary to me, 
verse:26:41 I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity; 
verse:26:42 then I will remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham; and I will remember the land. 
verse:26:43 The land also will be left by them, and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them: and they will accept the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes. 
verse:26:44 Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am HASHEM their God; 
verse:26:45 but I will for their sake remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am HASHEM.'"
verse:26:46 These are the statutes, ordinances and laws, which HASHEM made between him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses.
verse:27:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:27:2 "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, 'When a man makes a vow, the persons shall be for HASHEM by your valuation. 
verse:27:3 Your valuation shall be of a male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 
verse:27:4 If it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels. 
verse:27:5 If the person is from five years old even to twenty years old, then your valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels. 
verse:27:6 If the person is from a month old even to five years old, then your valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver, and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver. 
verse:27:7 If the person is from sixty years old and upward; if it is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels. 
verse:27:8 But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him who vowed shall the priest value him.
verse:27:9 "'If it is an animal, of which men offer an offering to HASHEM, all that any man gives of such to HASHEM becomes holy. 
verse:27:10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy. 
verse:27:11 If it is any unclean animal, of which they do not offer as an offering to HASHEM, then he shall set the animal before the priest; 
verse:27:12 and the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad. As you the priest values it, so shall it be. 
verse:27:13 But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to its valuation.
verse:27:14 "'When a man dedicates his house to be holy to HASHEM, then the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad: as the priest shall evaluate it, so shall it stand. 
verse:27:15 If he who dedicates it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be his.
verse:27:16 "'If a man dedicates to HASHEM part of the field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it: the sowing of a omer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver. 
verse:27:17 If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand. 
verse:27:18 But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the Year of Jubilee; and an abatement shall be made from your valuation. 
verse:27:19 If he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall remain his. 
verse:27:20 If he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more; 
verse:27:21 but the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy to HASHEM, as a field devoted; it shall be owned by the priests.
verse:27:22 "'If he dedicates to HASHEM a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession, 
verse:27:23 then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to the Year of Jubilee; and he shall give your valuation on that day, as a holy thing to HASHEM. 
verse:27:24 In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs. 
verse:27:25 All your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs to the shekel.
verse:27:26 "'Only the firstborn among animals, which is made a firstborn to HASHEM, no man may dedicate it; whether an ox or sheep, it is HASHEM's. 
verse:27:27 If it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back according to your valuation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it: or if it isn't redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.
verse:27:28 "'Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to HASHEM of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to HASHEM.
verse:27:29 "'No one devoted, who shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
verse:27:30 "'All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is HASHEM's. It is holy to HASHEM. 
verse:27:31 If a man redeems anything of his tithe, he shall add a fifth part to it. 
verse:27:32 All the tithe of the herds or the flocks, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to HASHEM. 
verse:27:33 He shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he changes it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy. It shall not be redeemed.'"
verse:27:34 These are the commandments which HASHEM commanded Moses for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai. 
portion:Numbers 19:1 - 20:6
verse:19:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
verse:19:2 "This is the statute of the law which HASHEM has commanded: Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring you a red heifer without spot, in which is no blemish, and which was never yoked. 
verse:19:3 You shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth outside of the camp, and one shall kill her before his face: 
verse:19:4 and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the Tent of Meeting seven times. 
verse:19:5 One shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn: 
verse:19:6 and the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer. 
verse:19:7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening. 
verse:19:8 He who burns her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.
verse:19:9 "A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up outside of the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water for impurity: it is a sin offering. 
verse:19:10 He who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: and it shall be to the children of Israel, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them, for a statute forever.
verse:19:11 "He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days: 
verse:19:12 the same shall purify himself with water on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he doesn't purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean. 
verse:19:13 Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a man who has died, and doesn't purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of HASHEM; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet on him.
verse:19:14 "This is the law when a man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. 
verse:19:15 Every open vessel, which has no covering bound on it, is unclean.
verse:19:16 "Whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
verse:19:17 "For the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin offering; and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel: 
verse:19:18 and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, and on all the vessels, and on the persons who were there, and on him who touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave: 
verse:19:19 and the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify him; and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at evening. 
verse:19:20 But the man who shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of HASHEM: the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean. 
verse:19:21 It shall be a perpetual statute to them: and he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening.
verse:19:22 "Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the soul that touches it shall be unclean until evening."
verse:20:1 The children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month: and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. 
verse:20:2 There was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. 
verse:20:3 The people strove with Moses, and spoke, saying, "We wish that we had died when our brothers died before HASHEM! 
verse:20:4 Why have you brought the assembly of HASHEM into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our animals? 
verse:20:5 Why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink."
verse:20:6 Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and fell on their faces: and the glory of HASHEM appeared to them.
portion:Numbers 20:7 - 20:21
verse:20:7 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:20:8 "Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and you shall bring forth to them water out of the rock; so you shall give the congregation and their livestock drink."
verse:20:9 Moses took the rod from before HASHEM, as he commanded him. 
verse:20:10 Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, "Hear now, you rebels; shall we bring you water out of this rock for you?" 
verse:20:11 Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their livestock.
verse:20:12 HASHEM said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you didn't believe in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them."
verse:20:13 These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with HASHEM, and he was sanctified in them. 
verse:20:14 Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying:
"Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the travail that has happened to us: 
verse:20:15 how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and our fathers: 
verse:20:16 and when we cried to HASHEM, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt: and behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of your border.
verse:20:17 "Please let us pass through your land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go along the king's highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your border."
verse:20:18 Edom said to him, "You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against you."
verse:20:19 The children of Israel said to him, "We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of your water, I and my livestock, then will I give its price: let me only, without doing anything else, pass through on my feet."
verse:20:20 He said, "You shall not pass through." Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand. 
verse:20:21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border, so Israel turned away from him.
portion:Numbers 20:22 - 21:20
verse:20:22 They traveled from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor. 
verse:20:23 HASHEM spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying, 
verse:20:24 "Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah. 
verse:20:25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor; 
verse:20:26 and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be taken, and shall die there."
verse:20:27 Moses did as HASHEM commanded: and they went up into Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. 
verse:20:28 Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. 
verse:20:29 When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
verse:21:1 The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive. 
verse:21:2 Israel vowed a vow to HASHEM, and said, "If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities." 
verse:21:3 HASHEM listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and the name of the place was called Hormah.
verse:21:4 They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Sea of Suf, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. 
verse:21:5 The people spoke against God, and against Moses, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loathes this light bread."
verse:21:6 HASHEM sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many people of Israel died. 
verse:21:7 The people came to Moses, and said, "We have sinned, because we have spoken against HASHEM, and against you. Pray to HASHEM, that he take away the serpents from us." Moses prayed for the people.
verse:21:8 HASHEM said to Moses, "Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a standard: and it shall happen, that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live." 
verse:21:9 Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it on the standard: and it happened, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked to the serpent of brass, he lived. 
verse:21:10 The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in Oboth. 
verse:21:11 They traveled from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise. 
verse:21:12 From there they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered. 
verse:21:13 From there they traveled, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that comes out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 
verse:21:14 Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of HASHEM, "Vaheb in Suphah, the valleys of the Arnon, 
verse:21:15 the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moab."
verse:21:16 From there they traveled to Beer: that is the well of which HASHEM said to Moses, "Gather the people together, and I will give them water."
verse:21:17 Then sang Israel this song: "Spring up, well; sing to it: 
verse:21:18 the well, which the princes dug, which the nobles of the people dug, with the scepter, and with their poles." 
From the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah; 
verse:21:19 and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth; 
verse:21:20 and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert.
portion:Numbers 21:21 - 22:1221:21} Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, 
verse:21:22 "Let me pass through your land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's highway, until we have passed your border."
verse:21:23 Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel. 
verse:21:24 Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. 
verse:21:25 Israel took all these cities: and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its towns. 
verse:21:26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon. 
verse:21:27 Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, "Come to Heshbon. Let the city of Sihon be built and established; 
verse:21:28 for a fire has gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It has devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of the Arnon. 
verse:21:29 Woe to you, Moab! You are undone, people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites. 
verse:21:30 We have shot at them. Heshbon has perished even to Dibon. We have laid waste even to Nophah, Which reaches to Medeba."
verse:21:31 Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites. 
verse:21:32 Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took its towns, and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
verse:21:33 They turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
verse:21:34 HASHEM said to Moses, "Don't fear him: for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people, and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon."
verse:21:35 So they struck him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land.
verse:22:1 The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho. 
verse:22:2 Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. 
verse:22:3 Moab was very afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel. 
verse:22:4 Moab said to the elders of Midian, "Now this multitude will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field."
Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. 
verse:22:5 He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, "Behold, there is a people who came out from Egypt. Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they are staying opposite me. 
verse:22:6 Please come now therefore curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed."
verse:22:7 The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak. 
verse:22:8 He said to them, "Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as HASHEM shall speak to me." The princes of Moab stayed with Balaam. 
verse:22:9 God came to Balaam, and said, "Who are these men with you?" 
verse:22:10 Balaam said to God, "Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has said to me, 
verse:22:11 'Behold, the people that has come out of Egypt, it covers the surface of the earth: now, come curse me them; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.'"
verse:22:12 God said to Balaam, "You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people; for they are blessed."
portion:Numbers 22:13 - 22:38
verse:22:13 Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, "Go to your land; for HASHEM refuses to permit me to go with you."
verse:22:14 The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, "Balaam refuses to come with us."
verse:22:15 Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they. 
verse:22:16 They came to Balaam, and said to him, "Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, 'Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me: 
verse:22:17 for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.'"
verse:22:18 Balaam answered the servants of Balak, "If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word of HASHEM my God, to do less or more. 
verse:22:19 Now therefore, please wait also here this night, that I may know what HASHEM will speak to me more."
verse:22:20 God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, "If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do."
verse:22:21 Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab. 
verse:22:22 God's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of HASHEM placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him. 
verse:22:23 The donkey saw the angel of HASHEM standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the way. 
verse:22:24 Then the angel of HASHEM stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side. 
verse:22:25 The donkey saw the angel of HASHEM, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he struck her again.
verse:22:26 The angel of HASHEM went further, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. 
verse:22:27 The donkey saw the angel of HASHEM, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.
verse:22:28 HASHEM opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?"
verse:22:29 Balaam said to the donkey, "Because you have mocked me, I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you."
verse:22:30 The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to you?"
He said, "No."
verse:22:31 Then HASHEM opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of HASHEM standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face. 
verse:22:32 The angel of HASHEM said to him, "Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come forth as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me: 
verse:22:33 and the donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times. Unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved her alive."
verse:22:34 Balaam said to the angel of HASHEM, "I have sinned; for I didn't know that you stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases you, I will go back again."
verse:22:35 The angel of HASHEM said to Balaam, "Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak."
So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. 
verse:22:36 When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border. 
verse:22:37 Balak said to Balaam, "Didn't I earnestly send to you to call you? Why didn't you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?"
verse:22:38 Balaam said to Balak, "Behold, I have come to you: have I now any power at all to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak."
portion:Numbers 22:39 - 23:26
verse:22:39 Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth. 
verse:22:40 Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who were with him. 
verse:22:41 It happened in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there the utmost part of the people.
verse:23:1 Balaam said to Balak, "Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams."
verse:23:2 Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram. 
verse:23:3 Balaam said to Balak, "Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go: perhaps HASHEM will come to meet me; and whatever he shows me I will tell you."
He went to a bare height. 
verse:23:4 God met Balaam: and he said to him, "I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar."
verse:23:5 HASHEM put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak."
verse:23:6 He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab. 
verse:23:7 He took up his parable, and said, "From Aram has Balak brought me, the king of Moab from the mountains of the East. Come, curse Jacob for me. Come, defy Israel. 
verse:23:8 How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? How shall I defy whom HASHEM has not defied? 
verse:23:9 For from the top of the rocks I see him. From the hills I see him. Behold, it is a people that dwells alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations. 
verse:23:10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous! Let my last end be like his!"
verse:23:11 Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them altogether."
verse:23:12 He answered and said, "Must I not take heed to speak that which HASHEM puts in my mouth?"
verse:23:13 Balak said to him, "Please come with me to another place, where you may see them; you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them from there."
verse:23:14 He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar. 
verse:23:15 He said to Balak, "Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet over there."
verse:23:16 HASHEM met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and say this."
verse:23:17 He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. Balak said to him, "What has HASHEM spoken?"
verse:23:18 He took up his parable, and said, "Rise up, Balak, and hear! Listen to me, you son of Zippor. 
verse:23:19 God is not a man, that he should lie, nor the son of man, that he should repent. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good? 
verse:23:20 Behold, I have received a command to bless. He has blessed, and I can't reverse it. 
verse:23:21 He has not seen iniquity in Jacob. Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel. HASHEM his God is with him. The shout of a king is among them. 
verse:23:22 God brings them out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of the wild ox. 
verse:23:23 Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there any divination with Israel. Now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God done! 
verse:23:24 Behold, the people rises up as a lioness, As a lion he lifts himself up. He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drinks the blood of the slain."
verse:23:25 Balak said to Balaam, "Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all."
verse:23:26 But Balaam answered Balak, "Didn't I tell you, saying, 'All that HASHEM speaks, that I must do?'"
portion:Numbers 23:27 - 25:9
verse:23:27 Balak said to Balaam, "Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse me them from there."
verse:23:28 Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down on the desert. 
verse:23:29 Balaam said to Balak, "Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams."
verse:23:30 Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.
verse:24:1 When Balaam saw that it pleased HASHEM to bless Israel, he didn't go, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness. 
verse:24:2 Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him. 
verse:24:3 He took up his parable, and said, "Balaam the son of Beor says, the man whose eye was closed says; 
verse:24:4 he says, who hears the words of God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, and having his eyes open: 
verse:24:5 How goodly are your tents, Jacob, and your tents, Israel! 
verse:24:6 As valleys they are spread forth, as gardens by the riverside, as aloes which HASHEM has planted, as cedar trees beside the waters. 
verse:24:7 Water shall flow from his buckets. His seed shall be in many waters. His king shall be higher than Agag. His kingdom shall be exalted. 
verse:24:8 God brings him out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of the wild ox. He shall eat up the nations his adversaries, shall break their bones in pieces, and pierce them with his arrows. 
verse:24:9 He couched, he lay down as a lion, as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? Everyone who blesses you is blessed. Everyone who curses you is cursed."
verse:24:10 Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, "I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times. 
verse:24:11 Therefore now flee you to your place! I thought to promote you to great honor; but, behold, HASHEM has kept you back from honor."
verse:24:12 Balaam said to Balak, "Didn't I also tell your messengers who you sent to me, saying, 
verse:24:13 'If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word of HASHEM, to do either good or bad of my own mind. I will say what HASHEM says'? 
verse:24:14 Now, behold, I go to my people: come, I will inform you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days."
verse:24:15 He took up his parable, and said, "Balaam the son of Beor says, the man whose eye was closed says; 
verse:24:16 he says, who hears the words of God, knows the knowledge of the Most High, and who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open: 
verse:24:17 I see him, but not now. I see him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob. A scepter will rise out of Israel, and shall strike through the corners of Moab, and break down all the sons of Sheth. 
verse:24:18 Edom shall be a possession. Seir, his enemies, also shall be a possession, while Israel does valiantly. 
verse:24:19 Out of Jacob shall one have dominion, and shall destroy the remnant from the city."
verse:24:20 He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, "Amalek was the first of the nations, But his latter end shall come to destruction."
verse:24:21 He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said, "Your dwelling place is strong. Your nest is set in the rock. 
verse:24:22 Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, until Asshur carries you away captive."
verse:24:23 He took up his parable, and said, "Alas, who shall live when God does this? 
verse:24:24 But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim. They shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber. He also shall come to destruction."
verse:24:25 Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.
verse:25:1 Israel stayed in Shittim; and the people began to play the prostitute with the daughters of Moab: 
verse:25:2 for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods; and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods. 
verse:25:3 Israel joined himself to Baal Peor: and the anger of HASHEM was kindled against Israel. 
verse:25:4 HASHEM said to Moses, "Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up to HASHEM before the sun, that the fierce anger of HASHEM may turn away from Israel."
verse:25:5 Moses said to the judges of Israel, "Everyone kill his men who have joined themselves to Baal Peor."
verse:25:6 Behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:25:7 When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand; 
verse:25:8 and he went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. 
verse:25:9 Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.
portion:Numbers 19:1 - 25:9
verse:19:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
verse:19:2 "This is the statute of the law which HASHEM has commanded: Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring you a red heifer without spot, in which is no blemish, and which was never yoked. 
verse:19:3 You shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth outside of the camp, and one shall kill her before his face: 
verse:19:4 and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the Tent of Meeting seven times. 
verse:19:5 One shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn: 
verse:19:6 and the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer. 
verse:19:7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening. 
verse:19:8 He who burns her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.
verse:19:9 "A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up outside of the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water for impurity: it is a sin offering. 
verse:19:10 He who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: and it shall be to the children of Israel, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them, for a statute forever.
verse:19:11 "He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days: 
verse:19:12 the same shall purify himself with water on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he doesn't purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean. 
verse:19:13 Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a man who has died, and doesn't purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of HASHEM; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet on him.
verse:19:14 "This is the law when a man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. 
verse:19:15 Every open vessel, which has no covering bound on it, is unclean.
verse:19:16 "Whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
verse:19:17 "For the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin offering; and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel: 
verse:19:18 and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, and on all the vessels, and on the persons who were there, and on him who touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave: 
verse:19:19 and the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify him; and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at evening. 
verse:19:20 But the man who shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of HASHEM: the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean. 
verse:19:21 It shall be a perpetual statute to them: and he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening.
verse:19:22 "Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the soul that touches it shall be unclean until evening."
verse:20:1 The children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month: and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. 
verse:20:2 There was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. 
verse:20:3 The people strove with Moses, and spoke, saying, "We wish that we had died when our brothers died before HASHEM! 
verse:20:4 Why have you brought the assembly of HASHEM into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our animals? 
verse:20:5 Why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink."
verse:20:6 Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and fell on their faces: and the glory of HASHEM appeared to them. 
verse:20:7 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:20:8 "Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and you shall bring forth to them water out of the rock; so you shall give the congregation and their livestock drink."
verse:20:9 Moses took the rod from before HASHEM, as he commanded him. 
verse:20:10 Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, "Hear now, you rebels; shall we bring you water out of this rock for you?" 
verse:20:11 Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their livestock.
verse:20:12 HASHEM said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you didn't believe in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them."
verse:20:13 These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with HASHEM, and he was sanctified in them. 
verse:20:14 Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying:
"Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the travail that has happened to us: 
verse:20:15 how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and our fathers: 
verse:20:16 and when we cried to HASHEM, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt: and behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of your border.
verse:20:17 "Please let us pass through your land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go along the king's highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your border."
verse:20:18 Edom said to him, "You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against you."
verse:20:19 The children of Israel said to him, "We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of your water, I and my livestock, then will I give its price: let me only, without doing anything else, pass through on my feet."
verse:20:20 He said, "You shall not pass through." Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand. 
verse:20:21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border, so Israel turned away from him.
verse:20:22 They traveled from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor. 
verse:20:23 HASHEM spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying, 
verse:20:24 "Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah. 
verse:20:25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor; 
verse:20:26 and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be taken, and shall die there."
verse:20:27 Moses did as HASHEM commanded: and they went up into Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. 
verse:20:28 Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. 
verse:20:29 When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
verse:21:1 The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive. 
verse:21:2 Israel vowed a vow to HASHEM, and said, "If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities." 
verse:21:3 HASHEM listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and the name of the place was called Hormah.
verse:21:4 They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Sea of Suf, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. 
verse:21:5 The people spoke against God, and against Moses, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loathes this light bread."
verse:21:6 HASHEM sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many people of Israel died. 
verse:21:7 The people came to Moses, and said, "We have sinned, because we have spoken against HASHEM, and against you. Pray to HASHEM, that he take away the serpents from us." Moses prayed for the people.
verse:21:8 HASHEM said to Moses, "Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a standard: and it shall happen, that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live." 
verse:21:9 Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it on the standard: and it happened, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked to the serpent of brass, he lived. 
verse:21:10 The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in Oboth. 
verse:21:11 They traveled from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise. 
verse:21:12 From there they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered. 
verse:21:13 From there they traveled, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that comes out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 
verse:21:14 Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of HASHEM, "Vaheb in Suphah, the valleys of the Arnon, 
verse:21:15 the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moab."
verse:21:16 From there they traveled to Beer: that is the well of which HASHEM said to Moses, "Gather the people together, and I will give them water."
verse:21:17 Then sang Israel this song: "Spring up, well; sing to it: 
verse:21:18 the well, which the princes dug, which the nobles of the people dug, with the scepter, and with their poles." 
From the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah; 
verse:21:19 and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth; 
verse:21:20 and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert. 
verse:21:21 Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, 
verse:21:22 "Let me pass through your land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's highway, until we have passed your border."
verse:21:23 Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel. 
verse:21:24 Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. 
verse:21:25 Israel took all these cities: and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its towns. 
verse:21:26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon. 
verse:21:27 Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, "Come to Heshbon. Let the city of Sihon be built and established; 
verse:21:28 for a fire has gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It has devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of the Arnon. 
verse:21:29 Woe to you, Moab! You are undone, people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites. 
verse:21:30 We have shot at them. Heshbon has perished even to Dibon. We have laid waste even to Nophah, Which reaches to Medeba."
verse:21:31 Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites. 
verse:21:32 Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took its towns, and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
verse:21:33 They turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
verse:21:34 HASHEM said to Moses, "Don't fear him: for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people, and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon."
verse:21:35 So they struck him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land.
verse:22:1 The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho. 
verse:22:2 Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. 
verse:22:3 Moab was very afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel. 
verse:22:4 Moab said to the elders of Midian, "Now this multitude will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field."
Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. 
verse:22:5 He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, "Behold, there is a people who came out from Egypt. Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they are staying opposite me. 
verse:22:6 Please come now therefore curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed."
verse:22:7 The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak. 
verse:22:8 He said to them, "Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as HASHEM shall speak to me." The princes of Moab stayed with Balaam. 
verse:22:9 God came to Balaam, and said, "Who are these men with you?" 
verse:22:10 Balaam said to God, "Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has said to me, 
verse:22:11 'Behold, the people that has come out of Egypt, it covers the surface of the earth: now, come curse me them; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.'"
verse:22:12 God said to Balaam, "You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people; for they are blessed."
verse:22:13 Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, "Go to your land; for HASHEM refuses to permit me to go with you."
verse:22:14 The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, "Balaam refuses to come with us."
verse:22:15 Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they. 
verse:22:16 They came to Balaam, and said to him, "Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, 'Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me: 
verse:22:17 for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.'"
verse:22:18 Balaam answered the servants of Balak, "If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word of HASHEM my God, to do less or more. 
verse:22:19 Now therefore, please wait also here this night, that I may know what HASHEM will speak to me more."
verse:22:20 God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, "If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do."
verse:22:21 Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab. 
verse:22:22 God's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of HASHEM placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him. 
verse:22:23 The donkey saw the angel of HASHEM standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the way. 
verse:22:24 Then the angel of HASHEM stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side. 
verse:22:25 The donkey saw the angel of HASHEM, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he struck her again.
verse:22:26 The angel of HASHEM went further, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. 
verse:22:27 The donkey saw the angel of HASHEM, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.
verse:22:28 HASHEM opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?"
verse:22:29 Balaam said to the donkey, "Because you have mocked me, I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you."
verse:22:30 The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to you?"
He said, "No."
verse:22:31 Then HASHEM opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of HASHEM standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face. 
verse:22:32 The angel of HASHEM said to him, "Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come forth as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me: 
verse:22:33 and the donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times. Unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved her alive."
verse:22:34 Balaam said to the angel of HASHEM, "I have sinned; for I didn't know that you stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases you, I will go back again."
verse:22:35 The angel of HASHEM said to Balaam, "Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak."
So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. 
verse:22:36 When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border. 
verse:22:37 Balak said to Balaam, "Didn't I earnestly send to you to call you? Why didn't you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?"
verse:22:38 Balaam said to Balak, "Behold, I have come to you: have I now any power at all to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak."
verse:22:39 Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth. 
verse:22:40 Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who were with him. 
verse:22:41 It happened in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there the utmost part of the people.
verse:23:1 Balaam said to Balak, "Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams."
verse:23:2 Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram. 
verse:23:3 Balaam said to Balak, "Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go: perhaps HASHEM will come to meet me; and whatever he shows me I will tell you."
He went to a bare height. 
verse:23:4 God met Balaam: and he said to him, "I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar."
verse:23:5 HASHEM put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak."
verse:23:6 He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab. 
verse:23:7 He took up his parable, and said, "From Aram has Balak brought me, the king of Moab from the mountains of the East. Come, curse Jacob for me. Come, defy Israel. 
verse:23:8 How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? How shall I defy whom HASHEM has not defied? 
verse:23:9 For from the top of the rocks I see him. From the hills I see him. Behold, it is a people that dwells alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations. 
verse:23:10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous! Let my last end be like his!"
verse:23:11 Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them altogether."
verse:23:12 He answered and said, "Must I not take heed to speak that which HASHEM puts in my mouth?"
verse:23:13 Balak said to him, "Please come with me to another place, where you may see them; you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them from there."
verse:23:14 He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar. 
verse:23:15 He said to Balak, "Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet over there."
verse:23:16 HASHEM met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and say this."
verse:23:17 He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. Balak said to him, "What has HASHEM spoken?"
verse:23:18 He took up his parable, and said, "Rise up, Balak, and hear! Listen to me, you son of Zippor. 
verse:23:19 God is not a man, that he should lie, nor the son of man, that he should repent. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good? 
verse:23:20 Behold, I have received a command to bless. He has blessed, and I can't reverse it. 
verse:23:21 He has not seen iniquity in Jacob. Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel. HASHEM his God is with him. The shout of a king is among them. 
verse:23:22 God brings them out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of the wild ox. 
verse:23:23 Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there any divination with Israel. Now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God done! 
verse:23:24 Behold, the people rises up as a lioness, As a lion he lifts himself up. He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drinks the blood of the slain."
verse:23:25 Balak said to Balaam, "Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all."
verse:23:26 But Balaam answered Balak, "Didn't I tell you, saying, 'All that HASHEM speaks, that I must do?'"
verse:23:27 Balak said to Balaam, "Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse me them from there."
verse:23:28 Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down on the desert. 
verse:23:29 Balaam said to Balak, "Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams."
verse:23:30 Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.
verse:24:1 When Balaam saw that it pleased HASHEM to bless Israel, he didn't go, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness. 
verse:24:2 Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him. 
verse:24:3 He took up his parable, and said, "Balaam the son of Beor says, the man whose eye was closed says; 
verse:24:4 he says, who hears the words of God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, and having his eyes open: 
verse:24:5 How goodly are your tents, Jacob, and your tents, Israel! 
verse:24:6 As valleys they are spread forth, as gardens by the riverside, as aloes which HASHEM has planted, as cedar trees beside the waters. 
verse:24:7 Water shall flow from his buckets. His seed shall be in many waters. His king shall be higher than Agag. His kingdom shall be exalted. 
verse:24:8 God brings him out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of the wild ox. He shall eat up the nations his adversaries, shall break their bones in pieces, and pierce them with his arrows. 
verse:24:9 He couched, he lay down as a lion, as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? Everyone who blesses you is blessed. Everyone who curses you is cursed."
verse:24:10 Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, "I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times. 
verse:24:11 Therefore now flee you to your place! I thought to promote you to great honor; but, behold, HASHEM has kept you back from honor."
verse:24:12 Balaam said to Balak, "Didn't I also tell your messengers who you sent to me, saying, 
verse:24:13 'If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word of HASHEM, to do either good or bad of my own mind. I will say what HASHEM says'? 
verse:24:14 Now, behold, I go to my people: come, I will inform you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days."
verse:24:15 He took up his parable, and said, "Balaam the son of Beor says, the man whose eye was closed says; 
verse:24:16 he says, who hears the words of God, knows the knowledge of the Most High, and who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open: 
verse:24:17 I see him, but not now. I see him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob. A scepter will rise out of Israel, and shall strike through the corners of Moab, and break down all the sons of Sheth. 
verse:24:18 Edom shall be a possession. Seir, his enemies, also shall be a possession, while Israel does valiantly. 
verse:24:19 Out of Jacob shall one have dominion, and shall destroy the remnant from the city."
verse:24:20 He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, "Amalek was the first of the nations, But his latter end shall come to destruction."
verse:24:21 He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said, "Your dwelling place is strong. Your nest is set in the rock. 
verse:24:22 Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, until Asshur carries you away captive."
verse:24:23 He took up his parable, and said, "Alas, who shall live when God does this? 
verse:24:24 But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim. They shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber. He also shall come to destruction."
verse:24:25 Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.
verse:25:1 Israel stayed in Shittim; and the people began to play the prostitute with the daughters of Moab: 
verse:25:2 for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods; and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods. 
verse:25:3 Israel joined himself to Baal Peor: and the anger of HASHEM was kindled against Israel. 
verse:25:4 HASHEM said to Moses, "Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up to HASHEM before the sun, that the fierce anger of HASHEM may turn away from Israel."
verse:25:5 Moses said to the judges of Israel, "Everyone kill his men who have joined themselves to Baal Peor."
verse:25:6 Behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:25:7 When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand; 
verse:25:8 and he went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. 
verse:25:9 Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.
portion:Numbers 30:2 - 31:12
verse:30:2 Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, "This is the thing which HASHEM has commanded. 
verse:30:3 When a man vows a vow to HASHEM, or swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
verse:30:4 "Also when a woman vows a vow to HASHEM, and binds herself by a bond, being in her father's house, in her youth, 
verse:30:5 and her father hears her vow, and her bond with which she has bound her soul, and her father holds his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand. 
verse:30:6 But if her father disallow her in the day that he hears, none of her vows, or of her bonds with which she has bound her soul, shall stand: and HASHEM will forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
verse:30:7 "If she has a husband, while her vows are on her, or the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul, 
verse:30:8 and her husband hears it, and hold his peace at her in the day that he hears it; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she has bound her soul shall stand. 
verse:30:9 But if her husband forbids her in the day that he hears it, then he shall make void her vow which is on her, and the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul: and HASHEM will forgive her.
verse:30:10 "But the vow of a widow, or of her who is divorced, everything with which she has bound her soul, shall stand against her.
verse:30:11 "If she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath, 
verse:30:12 and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and didn't disallow her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand.
portion:Numbers 31:13 - 31:54
verse:30:13 But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband has made them void; and HASHEM will forgive her. 
verse:30:14 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. 
verse:30:15 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds, which are on her: he has established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them. 
verse:30:16 But if he shall make them null and void after that he has heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity."
verse:30:17 These are the statutes, which HASHEM commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father's house.
verse:31:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:31:2 "Avenge the children of Israel for the Midianites. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people."
verse:31:3 Moses spoke to the people, saying, "Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute HASHEM's vengeance on Midian. 
verse:31:4 Of every tribe one thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, you shall send to the war." 
verse:31:5 So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. 
verse:31:6 Moses sent them, one thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the shofars for the alarm in his hand. 
verse:31:7 They warred against Midian, as HASHEM commanded Moses; and they killed every male. 
verse:31:8 They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they killed with the sword. 
verse:31:9 The children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their livestock, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey. 
verse:31:10 All their cities in the places in which they lived, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire. 
verse:31:11 They took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of animal. 
verse:31:12 They brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho. 
verse:31:13 Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them outside of the camp. 
verse:31:14 Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war. 
verse:31:15 Moses said to them, "Have you saved all the women alive? 
verse:31:16 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against HASHEM in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of HASHEM. 
verse:31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him. 
verse:31:18 But all the girls, who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
verse:31:19 "Encamp outside of the camp seven days: whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives. 
verse:31:20 As to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood, you shall purify yourselves."
verse:31:21 Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, "This is the statute of the law which HASHEM has commanded Moses: 
verse:31:22 however the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 
verse:31:23 everything that may withstand the fire, you shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity: and all that doesn't withstand the fire you shall make to go through the water. 
verse:31:24 You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean; and afterward you shall come into the camp."
verse:31:25 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:31:26 "Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of animal, you, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers' households of the congregation; 
verse:31:27 and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation. 
verse:31:28 Levy a tribute to HASHEM of the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred; of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks. 
verse:31:29 Take it of their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for HASHEM's wave offering. 
verse:31:30 Of the children of Israel's half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of all the livestock, and give them to the Levites, who perform the duty of the tabernacle of HASHEM."
verse:31:31 Moses and Eleazar the priest did as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:31:32 Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep, 
verse:31:33 and seventy-two thousand head of cattle, 
verse:31:34 and sixty-one thousand donkeys, 
verse:31:35 and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the women who had not known man by lying with him. 
verse:31:36 The half, which was the portion of those who went out to war, was in number three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep: 
verse:31:37 and HASHEM's tribute of the sheep was six hundred seventy-five. 
verse:31:38 The cattle were thirty-six thousand; of which HASHEM's tribute was seventy-two. 
verse:31:39 The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred; of which HASHEM's tribute was sixty-one. 
verse:31:40 The persons were sixteen thousand; of whom HASHEM's tribute was thirty-two persons. 
verse:31:41 Moses gave the tribute, which was HASHEM's wave offering, to Eleazar the priest, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:31:42 Of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided off from the men who warred 
verse:31:43 (now the congregation's half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep, 
verse:31:44 and thirty-six thousand head of cattle, 
verse:31:45 and thirty thousand five hundred donkeys, 
verse:31:46 and sixteen thousand persons), 
verse:31:47 even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animal, and gave them to the Levites, who performed the duty of the tabernacle of HASHEM; as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:31:48 The officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near to Moses; 
verse:31:49 and they said to Moses, "Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our command, and there lacks not one man of us. 
verse:31:50 We have brought HASHEM's offering, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for our souls before HASHEM."
verse:31:51 Moses and Eleazar the priest took their gold, even all worked jewels. 
verse:31:52 All the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to HASHEM, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels. 
verse:31:53 (The men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.) 
verse:31:54 Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the Tent of Meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel before HASHEM.
portion:Numbers 32:20 - 33:49
verse:32:20 Moses said to them, "If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves to go before HASHEM to the war, 
verse:32:21 and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before HASHEM, until he has driven out his enemies from before him, 
verse:32:22 and the land is subdued before HASHEM; then afterward you shall return, and be guiltless towards HASHEM, and towards Israel; and this land shall be to you for a possession before HASHEM.
verse:32:23 "But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against HASHEM; and be sure your sin will find you out. 
verse:32:24 Build cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth."
verse:32:25 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, "Your servants will do as my lord commands. 
verse:32:26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock, shall be there in the cities of Gilead; 
verse:32:27 but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before HASHEM to battle, as my lord says."
verse:32:28 So Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' households of the tribes of the children of Israel. 
verse:32:29 Moses said to them, "If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man who is armed to battle, before HASHEM, and the land shall be subdued before you; then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession: 
verse:32:30 but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan."
verse:32:31 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, "As HASHEM has said to your servants, so will we do. 
verse:32:32 We will pass over armed before HASHEM into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan."
verse:32:33 Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to its cities and borders, even the cities of the surrounding land. 
verse:32:34 The children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer, 
verse:32:35 and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah, 
verse:32:36 and Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep. 
verse:32:37 The children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim, 
verse:32:38 and Nebo, and Baal Meon, (their names being changed), and Sibmah: and they gave other names to the cities which they built. 
verse:32:39 The children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were therein. 
verse:32:40 Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he lived therein. 
verse:32:41 Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its towns, and called them Havvoth Jair. 
verse:32:42 Nobah went and took Kenath, and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name.

verse:34:18 You shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance. 
verse:34:19 These are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 
verse:34:20 Of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.

verse:35:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying, 
verse:35:2 "Command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and you shall give suburbs for the cities around them to the Levites. 
verse:35:3 The cities shall they have to dwell in; and their suburbs shall be for their livestock, and for their substance, and for all their animals.
verse:35:4 "The suburbs of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand cubits around it. 
verse:35:5 You shall measure outside of the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
verse:35:6 "The cities which you shall give to the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to: and besides them you shall give forty-two cities. 
verse:35:7 All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities together with their suburbs. 
verse:35:8 Concerning the cities which you shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many you shall take many; and from the few you shall take few: everyone according to his inheritance which he inherits shall give of his cities to the Levites."
portion:Numbers 35:9 - 36:13
verse:35:9 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:35:10 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
verse:35:11 then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer who kills any person unwittingly may flee there. 
verse:35:12 The cities shall be to you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer not die, until he stands before the congregation for judgment. 
verse:35:13 The cities which you shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge. 
verse:35:14 You shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge. 
verse:35:15 For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the foreigner living among them, shall these six cities be for refuge; that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there.
verse:35:16 "'But if he struck him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
verse:35:17 If he struck him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
verse:35:18 Or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
verse:35:19 The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death: when he meets him, he shall put him to death. 
verse:35:20 If he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died, 
verse:35:21 or in enmity struck him with his hand, so that he died; he who struck him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meets him.
verse:35:22 "'But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled on him anything without lying in wait, 
verse:35:23 or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him, and cast it on him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm; 
verse:35:24 then the congregation shall judge between the striker and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances; 
verse:35:25 and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, where he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
verse:35:26 "'But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, where he flees, 
verse:35:27 and the avenger of blood find him outside of the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kill the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood, 
verse:35:28 because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession.
verse:35:29 "'These things shall be for a statute and ordinance to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
verse:35:30 "'Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die.
verse:35:31 "'Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death.
verse:35:32 "'You shall take no ransom for him who is fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
verse:35:33 "'So you shall not pollute the land in which you are: for blood, it pollutes the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him who shed it. 
verse:35:34 You shall not defile the land which you inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I, HASHEM, dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.'"
verse:36:1 The heads of the fathers' households of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers' households of the children of Israel: 
verse:36:2 and they said, "HASHEM commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by HASHEM to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters. 
verse:36:3 If they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance. 
verse:36:4 When the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers."
verse:36:5 Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of HASHEM, saying, "The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right. 
verse:36:6 This is the thing which HASHEM does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married. 
verse:36:7 So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall all keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. 
verse:36:8 Every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers. 
verse:36:9 So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall each keep his own inheritance."
verse:36:10 The daughters of Zelophehad did as HASHEM commanded Moses: 
verse:36:11 for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons. 
verse:36:12 They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. 
verse:36:13 These are the commandments and the ordinances which HASHEM commanded by Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
portion:Numbers 30:2 - 36:13
verse:30:2 Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, "This is the thing which HASHEM has commanded. 
verse:30:3 When a man vows a vow to HASHEM, or swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
verse:30:4 "Also when a woman vows a vow to HASHEM, and binds herself by a bond, being in her father's house, in her youth, 
verse:30:5 and her father hears her vow, and her bond with which she has bound her soul, and her father holds his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand. 
verse:30:6 But if her father disallow her in the day that he hears, none of her vows, or of her bonds with which she has bound her soul, shall stand: and HASHEM will forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
verse:30:7 "If she has a husband, while her vows are on her, or the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul, 
verse:30:8 and her husband hears it, and hold his peace at her in the day that he hears it; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she has bound her soul shall stand. 
verse:30:9 But if her husband forbids her in the day that he hears it, then he shall make void her vow which is on her, and the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul: and HASHEM will forgive her.
verse:30:10 "But the vow of a widow, or of her who is divorced, everything with which she has bound her soul, shall stand against her.
verse:30:11 "If she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath, 
verse:30:12 and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and didn't disallow her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand. 
verse:30:13 But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband has made them void; and HASHEM will forgive her. 
verse:30:14 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. 
verse:30:15 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds, which are on her: he has established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them. 
verse:30:16 But if he shall make them null and void after that he has heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity."
verse:30:17 These are the statutes, which HASHEM commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father's house.
verse:31:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:31:2 "Avenge the children of Israel for the Midianites. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people."
verse:31:3 Moses spoke to the people, saying, "Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute HASHEM's vengeance on Midian. 
verse:31:4 Of every tribe one thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, you shall send to the war." 
verse:31:5 So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. 
verse:31:6 Moses sent them, one thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the shofars for the alarm in his hand. 
verse:31:7 They warred against Midian, as HASHEM commanded Moses; and they killed every male. 
verse:31:8 They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they killed with the sword. 
verse:31:9 The children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their livestock, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey. 
verse:31:10 All their cities in the places in which they lived, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire. 
verse:31:11 They took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of animal. 
verse:31:12 They brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho. 
verse:31:13 Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them outside of the camp. 
verse:31:14 Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war. 
verse:31:15 Moses said to them, "Have you saved all the women alive? 
verse:31:16 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against HASHEM in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of HASHEM. 
verse:31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him. 
verse:31:18 But all the girls, who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
verse:31:19 "Encamp outside of the camp seven days: whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives. 
verse:31:20 As to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood, you shall purify yourselves."
verse:31:21 Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, "This is the statute of the law which HASHEM has commanded Moses: 
verse:31:22 however the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 
verse:31:23 everything that may withstand the fire, you shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity: and all that doesn't withstand the fire you shall make to go through the water. 
verse:31:24 You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean; and afterward you shall come into the camp."
verse:31:25 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:31:26 "Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of animal, you, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers' households of the congregation; 
verse:31:27 and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation. 
verse:31:28 Levy a tribute to HASHEM of the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred; of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks. 
verse:31:29 Take it of their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for HASHEM's wave offering. 
verse:31:30 Of the children of Israel's half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of all the livestock, and give them to the Levites, who perform the duty of the tabernacle of HASHEM."
verse:31:31 Moses and Eleazar the priest did as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:31:32 Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep, 
verse:31:33 and seventy-two thousand head of cattle, 
verse:31:34 and sixty-one thousand donkeys, 
verse:31:35 and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the women who had not known man by lying with him. 
verse:31:36 The half, which was the portion of those who went out to war, was in number three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep: 
verse:31:37 and HASHEM's tribute of the sheep was six hundred seventy-five. 
verse:31:38 The cattle were thirty-six thousand; of which HASHEM's tribute was seventy-two. 
verse:31:39 The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred; of which HASHEM's tribute was sixty-one. 
verse:31:40 The persons were sixteen thousand; of whom HASHEM's tribute was thirty-two persons. 
verse:31:41 Moses gave the tribute, which was HASHEM's wave offering, to Eleazar the priest, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:31:42 Of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided off from the men who warred 
verse:31:43 (now the congregation's half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep, 
verse:31:44 and thirty-six thousand head of cattle, 
verse:31:45 and thirty thousand five hundred donkeys, 
verse:31:46 and sixteen thousand persons), 
verse:31:47 even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animal, and gave them to the Levites, who performed the duty of the tabernacle of HASHEM; as HASHEM commanded Moses.
verse:31:48 The officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near to Moses; 
verse:31:49 and they said to Moses, "Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our command, and there lacks not one man of us. 
verse:31:50 We have brought HASHEM's offering, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for our souls before HASHEM."
verse:31:51 Moses and Eleazar the priest took their gold, even all worked jewels. 
verse:31:52 All the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to HASHEM, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels. 
verse:31:53 (The men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.) 
verse:31:54 Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the Tent of Meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel before HASHEM.
verse:32:1 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold, the place was a place for livestock; 
verse:32:2 the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying, 
verse:32:3 "Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon, 
verse:32:4 the land which HASHEM struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock; and your servants have livestock." 
verse:32:5 They said, "If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession; don't bring us over the Jordan."
verse:32:6 Moses said to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, "Shall your brothers go to the war, and shall you sit here? 
verse:32:7 Why do you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which HASHEM has given them? 
verse:32:8 Your fathers did so when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land. 
verse:32:9 For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which HASHEM had given them. 
verse:32:10 HASHEM's anger was kindled in that day, and he swore, saying, 
verse:32:11 'Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me: 
verse:32:12 except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have followed HASHEM completely.' 
verse:32:13 HASHEM's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, who had done evil in the sight of HASHEM, was consumed.
verse:32:14 "Behold, you have risen up in your fathers' place, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of HASHEM toward Israel. 
verse:32:15 For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all this people."
verse:32:16 They came near to him, and said, "We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones: 
verse:32:17 but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. 
verse:32:18 We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance. 
verse:32:19 For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward."
verse:32:20 Moses said to them, "If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves to go before HASHEM to the war, 
verse:32:21 and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before HASHEM, until he has driven out his enemies from before him, 
verse:32:22 and the land is subdued before HASHEM; then afterward you shall return, and be guiltless towards HASHEM, and towards Israel; and this land shall be to you for a possession before HASHEM.
verse:32:23 "But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against HASHEM; and be sure your sin will find you out. 
verse:32:24 Build cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth."
verse:32:25 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, "Your servants will do as my lord commands. 
verse:32:26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock, shall be there in the cities of Gilead; 
verse:32:27 but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before HASHEM to battle, as my lord says."
verse:32:28 So Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' households of the tribes of the children of Israel. 
verse:32:29 Moses said to them, "If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man who is armed to battle, before HASHEM, and the land shall be subdued before you; then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession: 
verse:32:30 but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan."
verse:32:31 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, "As HASHEM has said to your servants, so will we do. 
verse:32:32 We will pass over armed before HASHEM into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan."
verse:32:33 Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to its cities and borders, even the cities of the surrounding land. 
verse:32:34 The children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer, 
verse:32:35 and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,

verse:33:52 then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, destroy all their stone idols, destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places. 
verse:33:53 You shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein; for I have given given the land to you to possess it. 
verse:33:54 You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance: wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his. You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers.
verse:33:55 "But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those you let remain of them will be as pricks in your eyes and as thorns in your sides, and they will harass you in the land in which you dwell. 
verse:33:56 It shall happen that as I thought to do to them, so will I do to you."
verse:34:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:34:2 "Command the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you come into the land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to its borders), 
verse:34:3 then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom, and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward; 
verse:34:4 and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and the goings out of it shall be southward of Kadesh Barnea; and it shall go forth to Hazar Addar, and pass along to Azmon; 
verse:34:5 and the border shall turn about from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.
verse:34:6 "'For the western border, you shall have the great sea and its border: this shall be your west border.
verse:34:7 "'This shall be your north border: from the great sea you shall mark out for you Mount Hor; 
verse:34:8 from Mount Hor you shall mark out to the entrance of Hamath; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad; 
verse:34:9 and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar Enan: this shall be your north border.
verse:34:10 "'You shall mark out your east border from Hazar Enan to Shepham; 
verse:34:11 and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward; 
verse:34:12 and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to its borders around it.'"
verse:34:13 Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, "This is the land which you shall inherit by lot, which HASHEM has commanded to give to the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe; 
verse:34:14 for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers' houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers' houses, have received, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received, their inheritance: 
verse:34:15 the two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrise."

verse:34:17 "These are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun. 
verse:34:18 You shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance. 
verse:34:19 These are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

verse:35:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying, 
verse:35:2 "Command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and you shall give suburbs for the cities around them to the Levites. 
verse:35:3 The cities shall they have to dwell in; and their suburbs shall be for their livestock, and for their substance, and for all their animals.
verse:35:4 "The suburbs of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand cubits around it. 
verse:35:5 You shall measure outside of the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
verse:35:6 "The cities which you shall give to the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to: and besides them you shall give forty-two cities. 
verse:35:7 All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities together with their suburbs. 
verse:35:8 Concerning the cities which you shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many you shall take many; and from the few you shall take few: everyone according to his inheritance which he inherits shall give of his cities to the Levites." 
verse:35:9 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:35:10 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
verse:35:11 then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer who kills any person unwittingly may flee there. 
verse:35:12 The cities shall be to you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer not die, until he stands before the congregation for judgment. 
verse:35:13 The cities which you shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge. 
verse:35:14 You shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge. 
verse:35:15 For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the foreigner living among them, shall these six cities be for refuge; that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there.
verse:35:16 "'But if he struck him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
verse:35:17 If he struck him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
verse:35:18 Or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
verse:35:19 The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death: when he meets him, he shall put him to death. 
verse:35:20 If he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died, 
verse:35:21 or in enmity struck him with his hand, so that he died; he who struck him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meets him.
verse:35:22 "'But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled on him anything without lying in wait, 
verse:35:23 or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him, and cast it on him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm; 
verse:35:24 then the congregation shall judge between the striker and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances; 
verse:35:25 and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, where he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
verse:35:26 "'But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, where he flees, 
verse:35:27 and the avenger of blood find him outside of the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kill the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood, 
verse:35:28 because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession.
verse:35:29 "'These things shall be for a statute and ordinance to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
verse:35:30 "'Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die.
verse:35:31 "'Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death.
verse:35:32 "'You shall take no ransom for him who is fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
verse:35:33 "'So you shall not pollute the land in which you are: for blood, it pollutes the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him who shed it. 
verse:35:34 You shall not defile the land which you inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I, HASHEM, dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.'"
verse:36:1 The heads of the fathers' households of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers' households of the children of Israel: 
verse:36:2 and they said, "HASHEM commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by HASHEM to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters. 
verse:36:3 If they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance. 
verse:36:4 When the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers."
verse:36:5 Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of HASHEM, saying, "The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right. 
verse:36:6 This is the thing which HASHEM does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married. 
verse:36:7 So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall all keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. 
verse:36:8 Every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers. 
verse:36:9 So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall each keep his own inheritance."
verse:36:10 The daughters of Zelophehad did as HASHEM commanded Moses: 
verse:36:11 for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons. 
verse:36:12 They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. 
verse:36:13 These are the commandments and the ordinances which HASHEM commanded by Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.

verse:29:12 that he may establish you this day to himself for a people, and that he may be to you a God, as he spoke to you, and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
verse:29:13 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath, 
verse:29:14 but with him who stands here with us this day before HASHEM our God, and also with him who is not here with us this day 
verse:29:15 (for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed; 
verse:29:16 and you have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them); 
verse:29:17 lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from HASHEM our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood; 
verse:29:18 and it happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, "I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry." 
verse:29:19 HASHEM will not pardon him, but then the anger of HASHEM and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie on him, and HASHEM will blot out his name from under the sky. 
verse:29:20 HASHEM will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this scroll of the Torah.
verse:29:21 The generation to come, your children who shall rise up after you, and the foreigner who shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses with which HASHEM has made it sick; 
verse:29:22 and that the whole land of it is sulfur, salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which HASHEM overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: 
verse:29:23 even all the nations shall say, "Why has HASHEM done thus to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?"
verse:29:24 Then men shall say, "Because they forsook the covenant of HASHEM, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, 
verse:29:25 and went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods that they didn't know, and that he had not given to them: 
verse:29:26 therefore the anger of HASHEM was kindled against this land, to bring on it all the curse that is written in this book; 
verse:29:27 and HASHEM rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day."

verse:30:9 HASHEM your God will make you plenteous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, for good: for HASHEM will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced over your fathers; 
verse:30:10 if you shall obey the voice of HASHEM your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this scroll of the Torah; if you turn to HASHEM your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.
verse:30:11 For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not too hard for you, neither is it far off. 
verse:30:12 It is not in heaven, that you should say, "Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?" 
verse:30:13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, "Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?" 
verse:30:14 But the word is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it.

verse:30:17 But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but shall be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; 
verse:30:18 I denounce to you this day, that you shall surely perish; you shall not prolong your days in the land, where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it. 
verse:30:19 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your seed; 
verse:30:20 to love HASHEM your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; for he is your life, and the length of your days; that you may dwell in the land which HASHEM swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.
verse:31:1 Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. 
verse:31:2 He said to them, "I am one hundred twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: and HASHEM has said to me, 'You shall not go over this Jordan.' 
verse:31:3 HASHEM your God, he will go over before you; he will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua shall go over before you, as HASHEM has spoken. 
verse:31:4 HASHEM will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land; whom he destroyed. 
verse:31:5 HASHEM will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you. 
verse:31:6 Be strong and courageous, don't be afraid, nor be scared of them: for HASHEM your God, he it is who does go with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you."

verse:31:7 Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous: for you shall go with this people into the land which HASHEM has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it. 
verse:31:8 HASHEM, he it is who does go before you; he will be with you, he will not fail you, neither forsake you: don't be afraid, neither be dismayed."
verse:31:9 Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of HASHEM, and to all the elders of Israel. 
verse:31:10 Moses commanded them, saying, "At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of booths, 
verse:31:11 when all Israel has come to appear before HASHEM your God in the place which he shall choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing. 
verse:31:12 Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and your foreigner who is within your gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear HASHEM your God, and observe to do all the words of this law; 
verse:31:13 and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and learn to fear HASHEM your God, as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it."
portion:Deuteronomy 31:20 - 31:30
verse:31:20 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant. 
verse:31:21 It shall happen, when many evils and troubles have come on them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I swore." 
verse:31:22 So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
verse:31:23 He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, "Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with you."
verse:31:24 It happened, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, 
verse:31:25 that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of HASHEM, saying, 
verse:31:26 "Take this scroll of the Torah, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of HASHEM your God, that it may be there for a witness against you. 
verse:31:27 For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against HASHEM; and how much more after my death? 
verse:31:28 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them. 
verse:31:29 For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days; because you will do that which is evil in the sight of HASHEM, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands."

verse:29:16 and you have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them); 
verse:29:17 lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from HASHEM our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood; 
verse:29:18 and it happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, "I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry." 
verse:29:19 HASHEM will not pardon him, but then the anger of HASHEM and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie on him, and HASHEM will blot out his name from under the sky. 
verse:29:20 HASHEM will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this scroll of the Torah.
verse:29:21 The generation to come, your children who shall rise up after you, and the foreigner who shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses with which HASHEM has made it sick; 
verse:29:22 and that the whole land of it is sulfur, salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which HASHEM overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: 
verse:29:23 even all the nations shall say, "Why has HASHEM done thus to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?"
verse:29:24 Then men shall say, "Because they forsook the covenant of HASHEM, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, 
verse:29:25 and went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods that they didn't know, and that he had not given to them: 
verse:29:26 therefore the anger of HASHEM was kindled against this land, to bring on it all the curse that is written in this book; 
verse:29:27 and HASHEM rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day."
verse:29:28 The secret things belong to HASHEM our God; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.
verse:30:1 It shall happen, when all these things have come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the nations, where HASHEM your God has driven you, 
verse:30:2 and shall return to HASHEM your God, and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day, you and your children, with all your heart, and with all your soul; 
verse:30:3 that then HASHEM your God will turn your captivity, and have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the peoples, where HASHEM your God has scattered you. 
verse:30:4 If your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens, from there will HASHEM your God gather you, and from there he will bring you back: 
verse:30:5 and HASHEM your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and he will do you good, and multiply you above your fathers. 
verse:30:6 HASHEM your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love HASHEM your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live. 
verse:30:7 HASHEM your God will put all these curses on your enemies, and on those who hate you, who persecuted you. 
verse:30:8 You shall return and obey the voice of HASHEM, and do all his commandments which I command you this day. 
verse:30:9 HASHEM your God will make you plenteous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, for good: for HASHEM will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced over your fathers; 
verse:30:10 if you shall obey the voice of HASHEM your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this scroll of the Torah; if you turn to HASHEM your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.
verse:30:11 For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not too hard for you, neither is it far off. 
verse:30:12 It is not in heaven, that you should say, "Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?" 
verse:30:13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, "Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?" 
verse:30:14 But the word is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it. 
verse:30:15 Behold, I have set before you this day life and good, and death and evil; 
verse:30:16 in that I command you this day to love HASHEM your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, that you may live and multiply, and that HASHEM your God may bless you in the land where you go in to possess it. 
verse:30:17 But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but shall be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; 
verse:30:18 I denounce to you this day, that you shall surely perish; you shall not prolong your days in the land, where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it. 
verse:30:19 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your seed; 
verse:30:20 to love HASHEM your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; for he is your life, and the length of your days; that you may dwell in the land which HASHEM swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.
verse:31:1 Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. 
verse:31:2 He said to them, "I am one hundred twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: and HASHEM has said to me, 'You shall not go over this Jordan.' 
verse:31:3 HASHEM your God, he will go over before you; he will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua shall go over before you, as HASHEM has spoken. 
verse:31:4 HASHEM will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land; whom he destroyed. 
verse:31:5 HASHEM will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you. 
verse:31:6 Be strong and courageous, don't be afraid, nor be scared of them: for HASHEM your God, he it is who does go with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you."
verse:31:7 Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous: for you shall go with this people into the land which HASHEM has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it. 
verse:31:8 HASHEM, he it is who does go before you; he will be with you, he will not fail you, neither forsake you: don't be afraid, neither be dismayed."
verse:31:9 Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of HASHEM, and to all the elders of Israel. 
verse:31:10 Moses commanded them, saying, "At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of booths, 
verse:31:11 when all Israel has come to appear before HASHEM your God in the place which he shall choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing. 
verse:31:12 Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and your foreigner who is within your gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear HASHEM your God, and observe to do all the words of this law; 
verse:31:13 and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and learn to fear HASHEM your God, as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it."
verse:31:14 HASHEM said to Moses, "Behold, your days approach that you must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, that I may commission him." Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting.
verse:31:15 HASHEM appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent. 
verse:31:16 HASHEM said to Moses, "Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and play the prostitute after the strange gods of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them. 
verse:31:17 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come on them; so that they will say in that day, 'Haven't these evils come on us because our God is not among us?' 
verse:31:18 I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have worked, in that they are turned to other gods.
verse:31:19 "Now therefore write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel. 
verse:31:20 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant. 
verse:31:21 It shall happen, when many evils and troubles have come on them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I swore." 
verse:31:22 So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
verse:31:23 He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, "Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with you."
verse:31:24 It happened, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, 
verse:31:25 that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of HASHEM, saying, 
verse:31:26 "Take this scroll of the Torah, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of HASHEM your God, that it may be there for a witness against you. 
verse:31:27 For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against HASHEM; and how much more after my death? 
verse:31:28 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them. 
verse:31:29 For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days; because you will do that which is evil in the sight of HASHEM, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands."
verse:31:30 Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.

verse:21:9 Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking. 
verse:21:10 Therefore she said to Abraham, "Cast out this handmaid and her son! For the son of this handmaid will not be heir with my son, Isaac."
verse:21:11 The thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son. 
verse:21:12 God said to Abraham, "Don't let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your handmaid. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For from Isaac will your seed be called.
portion:Genesis 21:13 - 21:21
verse:21:13 I will also make a nation of the son of the handmaid, because he is your seed." 
verse:21:14 Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child, and sent her away. She departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. 
verse:21:15 The water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. 
verse:21:16 She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, "Don't let me see the death of the child." She sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept. 
verse:21:17 God heard the voice of the boy.
The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, "What ails you, Hagar? Don't be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. 
verse:21:18 Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him in your hand. For I will make him a great nation."

verse:21:24 Abraham said, "I will swear." 
verse:21:25 Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. 
verse:21:26 Abimelech said, "I don't know who has done this thing. You didn't tell me, neither did I hear of it, until today."

portion:Genesis 21:28 - 21:34
verse:21:28 Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

verse:21:30 He said, "You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well." 
verse:21:31 Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because they both swore there. 
verse:21:32 So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.

verse:35:2 'Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be a holy day for you, a Sabbath of solemn rest to HASHEM: whoever does any work in it shall be put to death. 
verse:35:3 You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations on the Sabbath day.'"
verse:35:4 Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, "This is the thing which HASHEM commanded, saying, 
verse:35:5 'Take from among you an offering to HASHEM. Whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, HASHEM's offering: gold, silver, brass, 
verse:35:6 blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats' hair,

verse:35:12 the ark, and its poles, the mercy seat, the veil of the screen;

verse:35:20 All the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 
verse:35:21 They came, everyone whose heart stirred him up, and everyone whom his spirit made willing, and brought HASHEM's offering, for the work of the Tent of Meeting, and for all of its service, and for the holy garments. 
verse:35:22 They came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, and brought brooches, earrings, signet rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold; even every man who offered an offering of gold to HASHEM. 
verse:35:23 Everyone, with whom was found blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats' hair, rams' skins dyed red, and sea cow hides, brought them. 
verse:35:24 Everyone who offered an offering of silver and brass brought HASHEM's offering; and everyone, with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it. 
verse:35:25 All the women who were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, the blue, the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen. 
verse:35:26 All the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats' hair. 
verse:35:27 The rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set, for the ephod and for the breastplate; 
verse:35:28 and the spice, and the oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense. 
verse:35:29 The children of Israel brought a freewill offering to HASHEM; every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which HASHEM had commanded to be made by Moses.
verse:35:30 Moses said to the children of Israel, "Behold, HASHEM has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 
verse:35:31 He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship; 
verse:35:32 and to make skillful works, to work in gold, in silver, in brass, 
verse:35:33 in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of skillful workmanship. 
verse:35:34 He has put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 
verse:35:35 He has filled them with wisdom of heart, to work all kinds of workmanship, of the engraver, of the skillful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of those who do any workmanship, and of those who make skillful works.
verse:36:1 "Bezalel and Oholiab shall work with every wise-hearted man, in whom HASHEM has put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that HASHEM has commanded."
verse:36:2 Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart HASHEM had put wisdom, even everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to the work to do it: 
verse:36:3 and they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, with which to make it. They brought yet to him freewill offerings every morning. 
verse:36:4 All the wise men, who performed all the work of the sanctuary, each came from his work which they did. 
verse:36:5 They spoke to Moses, saying, "The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which HASHEM commanded to make."
verse:36:6 Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, "Let neither man nor woman make anything else for the offering for the sanctuary." So the people were restrained from bringing. 
verse:36:7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
verse:36:8 All the wise-hearted men among those who did the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, blue, purple, and scarlet, with cherubim, the work of the skillful workman, they made them. 
verse:36:9 The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. All the curtains had one measure. 
verse:36:10 He coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled one to another. 
verse:36:11 He made loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain from the edge in the coupling. Likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling. 
verse:36:12 He made fifty loops in the one curtain, and he made fifty loops in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling. The loops were opposite one to another. 
verse:36:13 He made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps: so the tabernacle was a unit.
verse:36:14 He made curtains of goats' hair for a covering over the tabernacle. He made them eleven curtains.

verse:40:1 HASHEM spoke to Moses, saying, 
verse:40:2 "On the first day of the first month you shall raise up the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:40:3 You shall put the ark of the testimony in it, and you shall screen the ark with the veil. 
verse:40:4 You shall bring in the table, and set in order the things that are on it. You shall bring in the menorah, and light its lamps. 
verse:40:5 You shall set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.
verse:40:6 "You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. 
verse:40:7 You shall set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and shall put water therein. 
verse:40:8 You shall set up the court around it, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court.
verse:40:9 "You shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is in it, and shall make it holy, and all its furniture: and it will be holy. 
verse:40:10 You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar will be most holy. 
verse:40:11 You shall anoint the basin and its base, and sanctify it.
verse:40:12 "You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and shall wash them with water. 
verse:40:13 You shall put on Aaron the holy garments; and you shall anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister to me in the priest's office. 
verse:40:14 You shall bring his sons, and put coats on them. 
verse:40:15 You shall anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may minister to me in the priest's office. Their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations." 
verse:40:16 Moses did so. According to all that HASHEM commanded him, so he did.
verse:40:17 It happened in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was raised up. 
verse:40:18 Moses raised up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and raised up its pillars. 
verse:40:19 He spread the covering over the tent, and put the roof of the tabernacle above on it, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:20 He took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the poles on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark. 
verse:40:21 He brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:22 He put the table in the Tent of Meeting, on the side of the tabernacle northward, outside of the veil. 
verse:40:23 He set the bread in order on it before HASHEM, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:24 He put the menorah in the Tent of Meeting, opposite the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. 
verse:40:25 He lit the lamps before HASHEM, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:26 He put the golden altar in the Tent of Meeting before the veil; 
verse:40:27 and he burnt incense of sweet spices on it, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:28 He put up the screen of the door to the tabernacle. 
verse:40:29 He set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:30 He set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water therein, with which to wash. 
verse:40:31 Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and their feet there. 
verse:40:32 When they went into the Tent of Meeting, and when they came near to the altar, they washed, as HASHEM commanded Moses. 
verse:40:33 He raised up the court around the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.
verse:40:34 Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of HASHEM filled the tabernacle. 
verse:40:35 Moses wasn't able to enter into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud stayed on it, and HASHEM's glory filled the tabernacle. 
verse:40:36 When the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys; 
verse:40:37 but if the cloud wasn't taken up, then they didn't travel until the day that it was taken up. 
verse:40:38 For the cloud of HASHEM was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.

verse:14:20 It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and the one didn't come near the other all the night.
verse:14:21 Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and HASHEM caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. 
verse:14:22 The children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left. 
verse:14:23 The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea: all of Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. 
verse:14:24 It happened in the morning watch, that HASHEM looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and confused the Egyptian army. 
verse:14:25 He took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, "Let's flee from the face of Israel, for HASHEM fights for them against the Egyptians!"
verse:14:26 HASHEM said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen." 
verse:14:27 Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it. HASHEM overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. 
verse:14:28 The waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even all Pharaoh's army that went in after them into the sea. There remained not so much as one of them. 
verse:14:29 But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left. 
verse:14:30 Thus HASHEM saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. 
verse:14:31 Israel saw the great work which HASHEM did to the Egyptians, and the people feared HASHEM; and they believed in HASHEM, and in his servant Moses.
verse:15:1 Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to HASHEM, and said, "I will sing to HASHEM, for he has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea. 
verse:15:2 HASHEM is my strength and song. He has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will praise him; my father's God, and I will exalt him. 
verse:15:3 HASHEM is a man of war. HASHEM is his name. 
verse:15:4 He has cast Pharaoh's chariots and his army into the sea. His chosen captains are sunk in the Sea of Suf. 
verse:15:5 The deeps cover them. They went down into the depths like a stone. 
verse:15:6 Your right hand, HASHEM, is glorious in power. Your right hand, HASHEM, dashes the enemy in pieces. 
verse:15:7 In the greatness of your excellency, you overthrow those who  rise up against you. You send forth your wrath. It consumes them as stubble. 
verse:15:8 With the blast of your nostrils, the waters were piled up. The floods stood upright as a heap. The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea. 
verse:15:9 The enemy said, 'I will pursue. I will overtake. I will divide  the spoil. My desire shall be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.' 
verse:15:10 You blew with your wind. The sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters. 
verse:15:11 Who is like you, HASHEM, among the gods? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? 
verse:15:12 You stretched out your right hand. The earth swallowed them.  
verse:15:13 "You, in your loving kindness, have led the people that you  have redeemed. You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation. 
verse:15:14 The peoples have heard. They tremble. Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia. 
verse:15:15 Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed. Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab. All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away. 
verse:15:16 Terror and dread falls on them. By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone-- until your people pass over, HASHEM, until the people pass over who you have purchased. 
verse:15:17 You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of  your inheritance, the place, HASHEM, which you have made for yourself to dwell in; the sanctuary, my Lord, which your hands have established. 
verse:15:18 HASHEM shall reign forever and ever."
verse:15:19 For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and HASHEM brought back the waters of the sea on them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea. 
verse:15:20 Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances. 
verse:15:21 Miriam answered them, "Sing to HASHEM, for he has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea."
verse:15:22 Moses led Israel onward from the Sea of Suf, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. 
verse:15:23 When they came to Marah, they couldn't drink from the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore its name was called Marah. 
verse:15:24 The people murmured against Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?" 
verse:15:25 Then he cried to HASHEM. HASHEM showed him a tree, and he threw it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there he tested them; 
verse:15:26 and he said, "If you will diligently listen to the voice of HASHEM your God, and will do that which is right in his eyes, and will pay attention to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you, which I have put on the Egyptians; for I am HASHEM who heals you."

verse:15:1 At the end of every seven years you shall make a release. 
verse:15:2 This is the way of the release: every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother; because HASHEM's release has been proclaimed.

verse:42:6 "I, HASHEM, have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand, and will keep you, and make you a covenant for the people, as a light for the nations; 
verse:42:7 to open the blind eyes, to bring the prisoners out of the dungeon, and those who sit in darkness out of the prison.
verse:42:8 "I am HASHEM. That is my name. I will not give my glory to another, nor my praise to engraved images. 
verse:42:9 Behold, the former things have happened, and I declare new things. I tell you about them before they come up."
verse:42:10 Sing to HASHEM a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the islands and their inhabitants. 
verse:42:11 Let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices, with the villages that Kedar inhabits. Let the inhabitants of Sela sing. Let them shout from the top of the mountains!

verse:42:21 It pleased HASHEM, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify the law, and make it honorable.

verse:43:4 Since you have been precious and honored in my sight, and I have loved you; therefore I will give people in your place, and nations instead of your life. 
verse:43:5 Don't be afraid; for I am with you. I will bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west.

verse:1:1 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he couldn't keep warm. 
verse:1:2 Therefore his servants said to him, "Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin. Let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm." 
verse:1:3 So they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 
verse:1:4 The young lady was very beautiful; and she cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king didn't know her intimately. 
verse:1:5 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, "I will be king." Then he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. 
verse:1:6 His father had not displeased him at any time in saying, "Why have you done so?" and he was also a very handsome man; and he was born after Absalom. 
verse:1:7 He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him. 
verse:1:8 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah. 
verse:1:9 Adonijah killed sheep and cattle and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel; and he called all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants: 
verse:1:10 but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he didn't call. 
verse:1:11 Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, "Haven't you heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord doesn't know it? 
verse:1:12 Now therefore come, please let me give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon. 
verse:1:13 Go in to king David, and tell him, 'Didn't you, my lord, king, swear to your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?' 
verse:1:14 Behold, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after you, and confirm your words."
verse:1:15 Bathsheba went in to the king into the room. The king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king. 
verse:1:16 Bathsheba bowed, and showed respect to the king. The king said, "What would you like?" 
verse:1:17 She said to him, "My lord, you swore by HASHEM your God[ to your handmaid, 'Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.' 
verse:1:18 Now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king, don't know it. 
verse:1:19 He has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army; but he hasn't called Solomon your servant. 
verse:1:20 You, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 
verse:1:21 Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders."
verse:1:22 Behold, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. 
verse:1:23 They told the king, saying, "Behold, Nathan the prophet!"
When he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. 
verse:1:24 Nathan said, "My lord, king, have you said, 'Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?' 
verse:1:25 For he is gone down this day, and has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest. Behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, 'Long live king Adonijah!' 
verse:1:26 But he hasn't called me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon. 
verse:1:27 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you haven't shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"
verse:1:28 Then king David answered, "Call to me Bathsheba." She came into the king's presence, and stood before the king. 
verse:1:29 The king swore, and said, "As HASHEM lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity, 
verse:1:30 most certainly as I swore to you by HASHEM, the God of Israel, saying, 'Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place;' most certainly so will I do this day."

verse:2:4 That HASHEM may establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, 'If your children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you,' he said, 'a man on the throne of Israel.'
verse:2:5 "Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, even what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his sash that was about his waist, and in his shoes that were on his feet. 
verse:2:6 Do therefore according to your wisdom, and don't let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace.

verse:3:16 Then two women who were prostitutes came to the king, and stood before him. 
verse:3:17 The one woman said, "Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house. I delivered a child with her in the house. 
verse:3:18 It happened the third day after I delivered, that this woman delivered also. We were together. There was no stranger with us in the house, just us two in the house. 
verse:3:19 This woman's child died in the night, because she lay on it. 
verse:3:20 She arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while your handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. 
verse:3:21 When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I bore."
verse:3:22 The other woman said, "No; but the living is my son, and the dead is your son."
This said, "No; but the dead is your son, and the living is my son." Thus they spoke before the king.
verse:3:23 Then the king said, "The one says, 'This is my son who lives, and your son is the dead;' and the other says, 'No; but your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.'" 
verse:3:24 The king said, "Get me a sword." They brought a sword before the king. 
verse:3:25 The king said, "Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to he other."

But the other said, "It shall be neither mine nor yours. Divide it."

portion:I Kings 5:26 - 6:13
verse:5:26 HASHEM gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a treaty together. 
verse:5:27 King Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. 
verse:5:28 He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the men subject to forced labor. 
verse:5:29 Solomon had seventy thousand who bore burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains; 
verse:5:30 besides Solomon's chief officers who were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bore rule over the people who labored in the work. 
verse:5:31 The king commanded, and they cut out great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with worked stone. 
verse:5:32 Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites cut them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.
verse:6:1 It happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of HASHEM. 
verse:6:2 The house which king Solomon built for HASHEM, its length was sixty cubits, and its breadth twenty, and its height thirty cubits. 
verse:6:3 The porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was its length, according to the breadth of the house. Ten cubits was its breadth before the house. 
verse:6:4 For the house he made windows of fixed lattice work. 
verse:6:5 Against the wall of the house he built stories all around, against the walls of the house all around, both of the temple and of the oracle; and he made side rooms all around. 
verse:6:6 The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house all around, that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house. 
verse:6:7 The house, when it was in building, was built of stone prepared at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building. 
verse:6:8 The door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house: and they went up by winding stairs into the middle story, and out of the middle into the third. 
verse:6:9 So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar. 
verse:6:10 He built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
verse:6:11 The word of HASHEM came to Solomon, saying, 
verse:6:12 "Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father.

verse:7:46 The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. 
verse:7:47 Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: the weight of the brass could not be found out.

verse:8:6 The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of HASHEM to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim. 
verse:8:7 For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above. 
verse:8:8 The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen outside: and there they are to this day. 
verse:8:9 There was nothing in the ark except the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when HASHEM made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. 
verse:8:10 It came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of HASHEM, 
verse:8:11 so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of HASHEM filled the house of HASHEM. 
verse:8:12 Then Solomon said, "HASHEM has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. 
verse:8:13 I have surely built you a house of habitation, a place for you to dwell in forever."
verse:8:14 The king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood. 
verse:8:15 He said, "Blessed is HASHEM, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David your father, and has with his hand fulfilled it, saying, 
verse:8:16 'Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.'
verse:8:17 "Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of HASHEM, the God of Israel. 
verse:8:18 But HASHEM said to David my father, 'Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart. 
verse:8:19 Nevertheless, you shall not build the house; but your son who shall come forth out of your body, he shall build the house for my name.'

verse:8:55 He stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying, 
verse:8:56 "Blessed be HASHEM, who has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised. There has not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by Moses his servant. 
verse:8:57 May HASHEM our God be with us, as he was with our fathers. Let him not leave us, nor forsake us; 
verse:8:58 that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers. 
verse:8:59 Let these my words, with which I have made supplication before HASHEM, be near to HASHEM our God day and night, that he may maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel, as every day shall require;

verse:8:61 "Let your heart therefore be perfect with HASHEM our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day."
verse:8:62 The king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before HASHEM. 
verse:8:63 Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to HASHEM, two and twenty thousand head of cattle, and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of HASHEM. 
verse:8:64 The same day the king made the middle of the court holy that was before the house of HASHEM; for there he offered the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before HASHEM was too little to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings. 
verse:8:65 So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before HASHEM our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.

verse:19:2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, "So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I don't make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time!"
verse:19:3 When he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there. 
verse:19:4 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, "It is enough. Now, O HASHEM, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers."
verse:19:5 He lay down and slept under a juniper tree; and behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, "Arise and eat!"
verse:19:6 He looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on the coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank, and lay down again.

Behold, HASHEM passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before HASHEM; but HASHEM was not in the wind. After the wind an earthquake; but HASHEM was not in the earthquake.

verse:19:13 It was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. Behold, a voice came to him, and said, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
verse:19:14 He said, "I have been very jealous for HASHEM, the God of Hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword. I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away."
verse:19:15 HASHEM said to him, "Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. When you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria. 
verse:19:16 You shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi to be king over Israel; and you shall anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah to be prophet in your place. 
verse:19:17 It shall happen, that he who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; and he who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha will kill. 
verse:19:18 Yet will I leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him."
verse:19:19 So he departed there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed over to him, and cast his mantle on him. 
verse:19:20 He left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, "Let me please kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you."
He said to him, "Go back again; for what have I done to you?"
verse:19:21 He returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and served him.
portion:I Kings 18:1 - 18:39
verse:18:1 It happened after many days, that the word of HASHEM came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, "Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I will send rain on the earth."
verse:18:2 Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria. 
verse:18:3 Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared HASHEM greatly: 
verse:18:4 for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of HASHEM, that Obadiah took one hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.) 
verse:18:5 Ahab said to Obadiah, "Go through the land, to all the springs of water, and to all the brooks. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not lose all the animals."
verse:18:6 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. 
verse:18:7 As Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, "Is it you, my lord Elijah?"
verse:18:8 He answered him, "It is I. Go, tell your lord, 'Behold, Elijah is here!'"
verse:18:9 He said, "Wherein have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? 
verse:18:10 As HASHEM your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent to seek you. When they said, 'He is not here,' he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they didn't find you. 
verse:18:11 Now you say, 'Go, tell your lord, "Behold, Elijah is here."' 
verse:18:12 It will happen, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of HASHEM will carry you I don't know where; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he can't find you, he will kill me. But I, your servant, have feared HASHEM from my youth. 
verse:18:13 Wasn't it told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of HASHEM, how I hid one hundred men of HASHEM's prophets with fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water? 
verse:18:14 Now you say, 'Go, tell your lord, "Behold, Elijah is here;"' and he will kill me."
verse:18:15 Elijah said, "As HASHEM of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today." 
verse:18:16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah. 
verse:18:17 It happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, "Is that you, you troubler of Israel?"
verse:18:18 He answered, "I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your father's house, in that you have forsaken the commandments of HASHEM, and you have followed the Baals. 
verse:18:19 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel, and four hundred fifty of the prophets of Baal, and four hundred of the prophets of the Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table."
verse:18:20 So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to Mount Carmel. 
verse:18:21 Elijah came near to all the people, and said, "How long will you waver between the two sides? If HASHEM is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him."
The people answered him not a word.
verse:18:22 Then Elijah said to the people, "I, even I only, am left a prophet of HASHEM; but Baal's prophets are four hundred fifty men. 
verse:18:23 Let them therefore give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bull, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under it. 
verse:18:24 You call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of HASHEM. The God who answers by fire, let him be God."
All the people answered, "It is well said."
verse:18:25 Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose one bull for yourselves, and dress it first; for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it."
verse:18:26 They took the bull which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any who answered. They leaped about the altar which was made. 
verse:18:27 It happened at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, "Cry aloud; for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he has gone aside, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleeps and must be awakened."
verse:18:28 They cried aloud, and cut themselves in their way with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them. 
verse:18:29 It was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the offering; but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any who regarded.
verse:18:30 Elijah said to all the people, "Come near to me;" and all the people came near to him. He repaired the altar of HASHEM that was thrown down. 
verse:18:31 Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of HASHEM came, saying, "Israel shall be your name." 
verse:18:32 With the stones he built an altar in the name of HASHEM. He made a trench around the altar, large enough to contain two measures of seed. 
verse:18:33 He put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. 
verse:18:34 He said, "Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood." He said, "Do it a second time;" and they did it the second time. He said, "Do it a third time;" and they did it the third time. 
verse:18:35 The water ran around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water.
verse:18:36 It happened at the time of the offering of the offering, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, "HASHEM, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. 
verse:18:37 Hear me, HASHEM, hear me, that this people may know that you, HASHEM, are God, and that you have turned their heart back again."
verse:18:38 Then the fire of HASHEM fell, and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. 
verse:18:39 When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces. They said, "HASHEM, he is God! HASHEM, he is God!"
portion:II Kings 4:1 - 4:37
verse:4:1 Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, "Your servant my husband is dead. You know that your servant feared HASHEM. Now the creditor has come to take for himself my two children to be slaves."
verse:4:2 Elisha said to her, "What shall I do for you? Tell me: what do you have in the house?"
She said, "Your handmaid has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil."
verse:4:3 Then he said, "Go, borrow containers from of all your neighbors, even empty containers. Don't borrow just a few. 
verse:4:4 You shall go in, and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour out into all those containers; and you shall set aside that which is full."
verse:4:5 So she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons; they brought the containers to her, and she poured out. 
verse:4:6 It happened, when the containers were full, that she said to her son, "Bring me another container."
He said to her, "There isn't another container." The oil stopped flowing.
verse:4:7 Then she came and told the man of God. He said, "Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest."
verse:4:8 It fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman; and she persuaded him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread. 
verse:4:9 She said to her husband, "See now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passes by us continually. 
verse:4:10 Please let us make a little room on the wall. Let us set for him there a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp stand. It shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in there."
verse:4:11 One day he came there, and he turned into the room and lay there. 
verse:4:12 He said to Gehazi his servant, "Call this Shunammite." When he had called her, she stood before him. 
verse:4:13 He said to him, "Say now to her, 'Behold, you have cared for us with all this care. What is to be done for you? Would you like to be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the army?'"
She answered, "I dwell among my own people."
verse:4:14 He said, "What then is to be done for her?"
Gehazi answered, "Most certainly she has no son, and her husband is old."
verse:4:15 He said, "Call her." When he had called her, she stood in the door. 
verse:4:16 He said, "At this season, when the time comes around, you will embrace a son."
She said, "No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your handmaid."
verse:4:17 The woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came around, as Elisha had said to her. 
verse:4:18 When the child was grown, it happened one day that he went out to his father to the reapers. 
verse:4:19 He said to his father, "My head! My head!"
He said to his servant, "Carry him to his mother."
verse:4:20 When he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died. 
verse:4:21 She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door on him, and went out. 
verse:4:22 She called to her husband, and said, "Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again."
verse:4:23 He said, "Why would you want go to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath."
She said, "It's alright."
verse:4:24 Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, "Drive, and go forward! Don't slow down for me, unless I ask you to."
verse:4:25 So she went, and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. It happened, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, "Behold, there is the Shunammite. 
verse:4:26 Please run now to meet her, and ask her, 'Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?'"
She answered, "It is well."
verse:4:27 When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, "Leave her alone; for her soul is troubled within her; and HASHEM has hidden it from me, and has not told me."
verse:4:28 Then she said, "Did I desire a son of my lord? Didn't I say, Do not deceive me?"
verse:4:29 Then he said to Gehazi, "Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand, and go your way. If you meet any man, don't greet him; and if anyone greets you, don't answer him again. Then lay my staff on the face of the child."
verse:4:30 The mother of the child said, "As HASHEM lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you."
He arose, and followed her.
verse:4:31 Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, "The child has not awakened."
verse:4:32 When Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid on his bed. 
verse:4:33 He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to HASHEM. 
verse:4:34 He went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. He stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child grew warm. 
verse:4:35 Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth; and went up, and stretched himself on him. Then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. 
verse:4:36 He called Gehazi, and said, "Call this Shunammite!" So he called her.
When she had come in to him, he said, "Take up your son."
verse:4:37 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.
portion:II Kings 4:42 - 5:19
verse:4:42 A man from Baal Shalishah came, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. He said, "Give to the people, that they may eat."
verse:4:43 His servant said, "What, should I set this before a hundred men?"
But he said, "Give the people, that they may eat; for thus says HASHEM, 'They will eat, and will have some left over.'"
verse:4:44 So he set it before them, and they ate, and left some of it, according to the word of HASHEM.
verse:5:1 Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him HASHEM had given victory to Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper. 
verse:5:2 The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of Eretz-Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman's wife. 
verse:5:3 She said to her mistress, "I wish that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of his leprosy."
verse:5:4 Someone went in, and told his lord, saying, "The maiden who is from Eretz-Israel said this."
verse:5:5 The king of Syria said, "Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel."
He departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing. 
verse:5:6 He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, "Now when this letter has come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy."
verse:5:7 It happened, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he tore his clothes, and said, "Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? But please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me."
verse:5:8 It was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, "Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel."
verse:5:9 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. 
verse:5:10 Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, "Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean."
verse:5:11 But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, "Behold, I thought, 'He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of HASHEM his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leper.' 
verse:5:12 Aren't Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn't I wash in them, and be clean?" So he turned and went away in a rage.
verse:5:13 His servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, "My father, if the prophet had asked you do some great thing, wouldn't you have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you, 'Wash, and be clean?'"
verse:5:14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. 
verse:5:15 He returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, "See now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, please take a gift from your servant."
verse:5:16 But he said, "As HASHEM lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none."
He urged him to take it; but he refused. 
verse:5:17 Naaman said, "If not, then, please let two mules' burden of earth be given to your servant; for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to HASHEM. 
verse:5:18 In this thing may HASHEM pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon. When I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may HASHEM pardon your servant in this thing."
verse:5:19 He said to him, "Go in peace." 
portion:II Kings 7:3 - 7:20
verse:7:3 Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate. They said one to another, "Why do we sit here until we die? 
verse:7:4 If we say, 'We will enter into the city,' then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. If we sit still here, we also die. Now therefore come, and let us surrender to the army of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we will live; and if they kill us, we will only die."
verse:7:5 They rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians. When they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there. 
verse:7:6 For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great army: and they said one to another, Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us. 
verse:7:7 Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life. 
verse:7:8 When these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drink, and carried there silver, and gold, and clothing, and went and hid it. Then they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried there also, and went and hid it. 
verse:7:9 Then they said one to another, "We aren't doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we keep silent. If we wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household."
verse:7:10 So they came and called to the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, "We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were."
verse:7:11 He called the porters; and they told it to the king's household within. 
verse:7:12 The king arose in the night, and said to his servants, "I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, 'When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.'"
verse:7:13 One of his servants answered, "Please let some take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are consumed. Let us send and see."
verse:7:14 They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the army of the Syrians, saying, "Go and see."
verse:7:15 They went after them to the Jordan; and behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. The messengers returned, and told the king. 
verse:7:16 The people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of HASHEM. 
verse:7:17 The king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate: and the people trod on him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him. 
verse:7:18 It happened, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, "Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria;" 
verse:7:19 and that captain answered the man of God, and said, "Now, behold, if HASHEM should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be?" and he said, "Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it." 
verse:7:20 It happened like that to him; for the people trod on him in the gate, and he died.
portion:Malachi 1:1-2:7
verse:1:1 An oracle: the word of HASHEM to Israel by Malachi.
verse:1:2 "I have loved you," says HASHEM.
Yet you say, "How have you loved us?"
"Wasn't Esau Jacob's brother?" says HASHEM, "Yet I loved Jacob; 
verse:1:3 but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness." 
verse:1:4 Whereas Edom says, "We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places;" thus says HASHEM of Hosts, "They shall build, but I will throw down; and men will call them 'The Wicked Land,' even the people against whom HASHEM shows wrath forever."
verse:1:5 Your eyes will see, and you will say, "HASHEM is great--even beyond the border of Israel!"
verse:1:6 "A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, then where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is the respect due me? Says HASHEM of Hosts to you, priests, who despise my name. You say, 'How have we despised your name?' 
verse:1:7 You offer polluted bread on my altar. You say, 'How have we polluted you?' In that you say, 'HASHEM's table contemptible.' 
verse:1:8 When you offer the blind for sacrifice, isn't that evil? And when you offer the lame and sick, isn't that evil? Present it now to your governor! Will he be pleased with you? Or will he accept your person?" says HASHEM of Hosts.
verse:1:9 "Now, please entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With this, will he accept any of you?" says HASHEM of Hosts.
verse:1:10 "Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you," says HASHEM of Hosts, "neither will I accept an offering at your hand. 
verse:1:11 For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same, my name is great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name is great among the nations," says HASHEM of Hosts. 
verse:1:12 "But you profane it, in that you say, 'HASHEM's table is polluted, and its fruit, even its food, is contemptible.' 
verse:1:13 You say also, 'Behold, what a weariness it is!' and you have sniffed at it," says HASHEM of Hosts; "and you have brought that which was taken by violence, the lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering. Should I accept this at your hand?" says HASHEM.
verse:1:14 "But the deceiver is cursed, who has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King," says HASHEM of Hosts, "and my name is awesome among the nations."
verse:2:1 "Now, you priests, this commandment is for you. 
verse:2:2 If you will not listen, and if you will not lay it to heart, to give glory to my name," says HASHEM of Hosts, "then will I send the curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have cursed them already, because you do not lay it to heart. 
verse:2:3 Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung on your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and you will be taken away with it. 
verse:2:4 You will know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant may be with Levi," says HASHEM of Hosts. 
verse:2:5 "My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that he might be reverent toward me; and he was reverent toward me, and stood in awe of my name. 
verse:2:6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity. 
verse:2:7 For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of HASHEM of Hosts.
portion:Hosea 2:1 - 2:22
verse:2:1 Yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which can't be measured nor numbered; and it will come to pass that, in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' they will be called 'sons of the living God.' 
verse:2:2 The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint themselves one head, and will go up from the land; for great will be the day of Jezreel.
verse:2:3 "Say to your brothers, 'My people!' and to your sisters, 'My loved one!' 
verse:2:4 Contend with your mother! Contend, for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband; and let her put away her prostitution from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts; 
verse:2:5 Lest I strip her naked, and make her bare as in the day that she was born, and make her like a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and kill her with thirst. 
verse:2:6 Indeed, on her children I will have no mercy; for they are children of unfaithfulness; 
verse:2:7 For their mother has played the prostitute. She who conceived them has done shamefully; for she said, 'I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.' 
verse:2:8 Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, that she can't find her way. 
verse:2:9 She will follow after her lovers, but she won't overtake them; and she will seek them, but won't find them. Then she will say, 'I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.' 
verse:2:10 For she did not know that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal. 
verse:2:11 Therefore I will take back my grain in its time, and my new wine in its season, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness. 
verse:2:12 Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and no one will deliver her out of my hand. 
verse:2:13 I will also cause all her celebrations to cease: her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies. 
verse:2:14 I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, about which she has said, 'These are my wages that my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest,' and the animals of the field shall eat them. 
verse:2:15 I will visit on her the days of the Baals, to which she burned incense, when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot me," says HASHEM. 
verse:2:16 "Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her. 
verse:2:17 I will give her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she will respond there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. 
verse:2:18 It will be in that day," says HASHEM, "that you will call me 'my husband,' and no longer call me 'my master.' 
verse:2:19 For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and they will no longer be mentioned by name. 
verse:2:20 In that day I will make a covenant for them with the animals of the field, and with the birds of the sky, and with the creeping things of the ground. I will break the bow, the sword, and the battle out of the land, and will make them lie down safely. 
verse:2:21 I will betroth you to me forever. Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, in justice, in loving kindness, and in compassion.

verse:12:15 Ephraim has bitterly provoked anger. Therefore his blood will be left on him, and his Lord will repay his contempt.

verse:13:7 Therefore I am like a lion to them. Like a leopard, I will lurk by the path. 
verse:13:8 I will meet them like a bear that is bereaved of her cubs, and will tear the covering of their heart. There I will devour them like a lioness. The wild animal will tear them. 
verse:13:9 You are destroyed, Israel, because you are against me, against your help. 
verse:13:10 Where is your king now, that he may save you in all your cities? And your judges, of whom you said, 'Give me a king and princes?' 
verse:13:11 I have given you a king in my anger, and have taken him away in my wrath. 
verse:13:12 The guilt of Ephraim is stored up. His sin is stored up.

verse:14:2 Israel, return to HASHEM your God; for you have fallen because of your sin. 
verse:14:3 Take words with you, and return to HASHEM. Tell him, "Forgive all our sins, and accept that which is good: so we offer our lips like bulls. 
verse:14:4 Assyria can't save us. We won't ride on horses; neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, 'Our gods!' for in you the fatherless finds mercy."
verse:14:5 "I will heal their waywardness. I will love them freely; for my anger is turned away from him. 
verse:14:6 I will be like the dew to Israel. He will blossom like the lily, and send down his roots like Lebanon.

verse:14:8 Men will dwell in his shade. They will revive like the grain, and blossom like the vine. Their fragrance will be like the wine of Lebanon. 
verse:14:9 Ephraim, what have I to do any more with idols? I answer, and will take care of him. I am like a green fir tree; from me your fruit is found."
verse:14:10 Who is wise, that he may understand these things? Who is prudent, that he may know them? For the ways of HASHEM are right, and the righteous walk in them; But the rebellious stumble in them. 
portion:Obadiah 1:1 - 1:21
verse:1:1 The vision of Obadiah. This is what the Lord HASHEM says about Edom. We have heard news from HASHEM, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, saying, "Arise, and let's rise up against her in battle.

verse:1:5 "If thieves came to you, if robbers by night--oh, what disaster awaits you--wouldn't they only steal until they had enough? If grape pickers came to you, wouldn't they leave some gleaning grapes? 
verse:1:6 How Esau will be ransacked! How his hidden treasures are sought out! 
verse:1:7 All the men of your alliance have brought you on your way, even to the border. The men who were at peace with you have deceived you, and prevailed against you. Friends who eat your bread lay a snare under you. There is no understanding in him."
verse:1:8 "Won't I in that day," says HASHEM, "destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mountain of Esau? 
verse:1:9 Your mighty men, Teman, will be dismayed, to the end that everyone may be cut off from the mountain of Esau by slaughter. 
verse:1:10 For the violence done to your brother Jacob, shame will cover you, and you will be cut off forever. 
verse:1:11 In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away his substance, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots for Jerusalem, even you were like one of them. 
verse:1:12 But don't look down on your brother in the day of his disaster, and don't rejoice over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction. Don't speak proudly in the day of distress. 
verse:1:13 Don't enter into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity. Don't look down on their affliction in the day of their calamity, neither seize their wealth on the day of their calamity. 
verse:1:14 Don't stand in the crossroads to cut off those of his who escape. Don't deliver up those of his who remain in the day of distress. 
verse:1:15 For the day of HASHEM is near all the nations! As you have done, it will be done to you. Your deeds will return upon your own head. 
verse:1:16 For as you have drunk on my holy mountain, so will all the nations drink continually. Yes, they will drink, swallow down, and will be as though they had not been. 
verse:1:17 But in Mount Zion, there will be those who escape, and it will be holy. The house of Jacob will possess their possessions. 
verse:1:18 The house of Jacob will be a fire, the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble. They will burn among them, and devour them. There will not be any remaining to the house of Esau." Indeed, HASHEM has spoken.
verse:1:19 Those of the South will possess the mountain of Esau, and those of the lowland, the Philistines. They will possess the field of Ephraim, and the field of Samaria. Benjamin will possess Gilead. 
verse:1:20 The captives of this army of the children of Israel, who are among the Canaanites, will possess even to Zarephath; and the captives of Jerusalem, who are in Sepharad, will possess the cities of the Negev.

verse:3:3 God came from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah.
His glory covered the heavens, and his praise filled the earth. 
verse:3:4 His splendor is like the sunrise. Rays shine from his hand, where his power is hidden. 
verse:3:5 Plague went before him, and pestilence followed his feet. 
verse:3:6 He stood, and shook the earth. He looked, and made the nations tremble. The ancient mountains were crumbled. The age-old hills collapsed. His ways are eternal. 
verse:3:7 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction. The dwellings of the land of Midian trembled. 
verse:3:8 Was HASHEM displeased with the rivers? Was your anger against the rivers, or your wrath against the sea, that you rode on your horses, on your chariots of salvation? 
verse:3:9 You uncovered your bow. You called for your sworn arrows. Selah. You split the earth with rivers. 
verse:3:10 The mountains saw you, and were afraid. The storm of waters passed by. The deep roared and lifted up its hands on high. 
verse:3:11 The sun and moon stood still in the sky, at the light of your arrows as they went, at the shining of your glittering spear. 
verse:3:12 You marched through the land in wrath. You threshed the nations in anger. 
verse:3:13 You went forth for the salvation of your people, for the salvation of your anointed. You crushed the head of the land of wickedness. You stripped them head to foot. Selah.
verse:3:14 You pierced the heads of his warriors with their own spears. They came as a whirlwind to scatter me, gloating as if to devour the wretched in secret. 
verse:3:15 You trampled the sea with your horses, churning mighty waters. 
verse:3:16 I heard, and my body trembled. My lips quivered at the voice. Rottenness enters into my bones, and I tremble in my place, because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble, for the coming up of the people who invade us. 
verse:3:17 For though the fig tree doesn't flourish, nor fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive fails, the fields yield no food; the flocks are cut off from the fold, and there is no herd in the stalls: 
verse:3:18 yet I will rejoice in HASHEM. I will be joyful in the God of my salvation! 
verse:3:19 HASHEM, my Lord, is my strength. He makes my feet like deer's feet, and enables me to go in high places.
For the music director, on my stringed instruments. 
portion:Amos 2:6 - 3:8
verse:2:6 Thus says HASHEM: "For three transgressions of Israel, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because they have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; 
verse:2:7 They trample on the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and deny justice to the oppressed; and a man and his father use the same maiden, to profane my holy name; 
verse:2:8 and they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined. 
verse:2:9 Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath. 
verse:2:10 Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite. 
verse:2:11 I raised up some of your sons for prophets, and some of your young men for Nazirites. Isn't this true, you children of Israel?" says HASHEM. 
verse:2:12 "But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, 'Don't prophesy!' 
verse:2:13 Behold, I will crush you in your place, as a cart crushes that is full of grain. 
verse:2:14 Flight will perish from the swift; and the strong won't strengthen his force; neither shall the mighty deliver himself; 
verse:2:15 neither shall he stand who handles the bow; and he who is swift of foot won't escape; neither shall he who rides the horse deliver himself; 
verse:2:16 and he who is courageous among the mighty will flee away naked on that day," says HASHEM.
verse:3:1 Hear this word that HASHEM has spoken against you, children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying: 
verse:3:2 "You only have I chosen of all the families of the earth. Therefore I will punish you for all of your sins." 
verse:3:3 Do two walk together, unless they have agreed? 
verse:3:4 Will a lion roar in the thicket, when he has no prey? Does a young lion cry out of his den, if he has caught nothing? 
verse:3:5 Can a bird fall in a trap on the earth, where no snare is set for him? Does a snare spring up from the ground, when there is nothing to catch? 
verse:3:6 Does the shofar alarm sound in a city, without the people being afraid? Does evil happen to a city, and HASHEM hasn't done it? 
verse:3:7 Surely HASHEM GOD will do nothing, unless he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets. 
verse:3:8 The lion has roared. Who will not fear? The HASHEM GOD has spoken. Who can but prophesy? 
portion:Amos 9:7 - 9:15
verse:9:7 Are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to me, children of Israel?" says HASHEM. "Haven't I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir? 
verse:9:8 Behold, the eyes of HASHEM GOD are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the surface of the earth; except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob," says HASHEM. 
verse:9:9 "For, behold, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, as grain is sifted in a sieve, yet not the least kernel will fall on the earth. 
verse:9:10 All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say, 'Evil won't overtake nor meet us.' 
verse:9:11 In that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen, and close up its breaches, and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old; 
verse:9:12 that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations who are called by my name," says HASHEM who does this. 
verse:9:13 "Behold, the days come," says HASHEM, "that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the one treading grapes him who sows seed; and sweet wine will drip from the mountains, and flow from the hills. 
verse:9:14 I will bring my people Israel back from captivity, and they will rebuild the ruined cities, and inhabit them; and they will plant vineyards, and drink wine from them. They shall also make gardens, and eat their fruit.

verse:5:6 The remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples, like dew from HASHEM, like showers on the grass, that don't wait for man, nor wait for the sons of men. 
verse:5:7 The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the animals of the forest, like a young lion among the flocks of sheep; who, if he goes through, treads down and tears in pieces, and there is no one to deliver. 
verse:5:8 Let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries, and let all of your enemies be cut off. 
verse:5:9 "It will happen in that day," says HASHEM, "That I will cut off your horses out of the midst of you, and will destroy your chariots.

verse:5:11 I will destroy witchcraft from your hand; and you shall have no soothsayers. 
verse:5:12 I will cut off your engraved images and your pillars out of your midst; and you shall no more worship the work of your hands. 
verse:5:13 I will uproot your Asherim out of your midst; and I will destroy your cities. 
verse:5:14 I will execute vengeance in anger, and wrath on the nations that didn't listen."
verse:6:1 Listen now to what HASHEM says: "Arise, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear what you have to say. 
verse:6:2 Hear, you mountains, HASHEM's controversy, and you enduring foundations of the earth; for HASHEM has a controversy with his people, and he will contend with Israel. 
verse:6:3 My people, what have I done to you? How have I burdened you? Answer me! 
verse:6:4 For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage. I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 
verse:6:5 My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of HASHEM."
verse:6:6 How shall I come before HASHEM, and bow myself before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old? 
verse:6:7 Will HASHEM be pleased with thousands of rams? With tens of thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience? The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? 
verse:6:8 He has shown you, O man, what is good. What does HASHEM require of you, but to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?

verse:2:15 Many nations shall join themselves to HASHEM in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in the midst of you, and you shall know that HASHEM of Hosts has sent me to you. 
verse:2:16 HASHEM will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. 
verse:2:17 Be silent, all flesh, before HASHEM; for he has roused himself from his holy habitation!"
verse:3:1 He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of HASHEM, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary. 
verse:3:2 HASHEM said to Satan, "HASHEM rebuke you, Satan! Yes, HASHEM who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn't this a burning stick plucked out of the fire?"
verse:3:3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel. 
verse:3:4 He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, "Take the filthy garments off of him." To him he said, "Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich clothing."
verse:3:5 I said, "Let them set a clean turban on his head."
So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him; and the angel of HASHEM was standing by. 
verse:3:6 The angel of HASHEM protested to Joshua, saying, 
verse:3:7 "Thus says HASHEM of Hosts: 'If you will walk in my ways, and if you will follow my instructions, then you also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you a place of access among these who stand by. 
verse:3:8 Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you; for they are men who are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant, the Branch. 
verse:3:9 For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave its engraving,' says HASHEM of Hosts, 'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 
verse:3:10 In that day,' says HASHEM of Hosts, 'you will invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.'"
verse:4:1 The angel who talked with me came again, and wakened me, as a man who is wakened out of his sleep. 
verse:4:2 He said to me, "What do you see?"
I said, "I have seen, and behold, a menorah all of gold, with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are on the top of it; 
verse:4:3 and two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side of it."
verse:4:4 I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, "What are these, my lord?"
verse:4:5 Then the angel who talked with me answered me, "Don't you know what these are?"
I said, "No, my lord."
verse:4:6 Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, "This is the word of HASHEM to Zerubbabel, saying, 'Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit,' says HASHEM of Hosts. 
verse:4:7 Who are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you are a plain; and he will bring out the capstone with shouts of 'Grace, grace, to it!'"
portion:Zechariah 14:1-21
verse:14:1 Behold, a day of HASHEM comes, when your spoil will be divided in your midst. 
verse:14:2 For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city will be taken, the houses rifled, and the women ravished. Half of the city will go out into captivity, and the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. 
verse:14:3 Then HASHEM will go out and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle. 
verse:14:4 His feet will stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in two, from east to west, making a very great valley. Half of the mountain will move toward the north, and half of it toward the south. 
verse:14:5 You shall flee by the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azel; yes, you shall flee, just like you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. HASHEM my God will come, and all the holy ones with you. 
verse:14:6 It will happen in that day, that there will not be light, cold, or frost. 
verse:14:7 It will be a unique day which is known to HASHEM; not day, and not night; but it will come to pass, that at evening time there will be light.
verse:14:8 It will happen in that day, that living waters will go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea; in summer and in winter will it be.
verse:14:9 HASHEM will be King over all the earth. In that day HASHEM will be one, and his name one. 
verse:14:10 All the land will be made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she will be lifted up, and will dwell in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses. 
verse:14:11 Men will dwell therein, and there will be no more curse; but Jerusalem will dwell safely. 
verse:14:12 This will be the plague with which HASHEM will strike all the peoples who have warred against Jerusalem: their flesh will consume away while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will consume away in their sockets, and their tongue will consume away in their mouth. 
verse:14:13 It will happen in that day, that a great panic from HASHEM will be among them; and they will lay hold everyone on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neighbor. 
verse:14:14 Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered together: gold, and silver, and clothing, in great abundance.
verse:14:15 So will be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the donkey, and of all the animals that will be in those camps, as that plague. 
verse:14:16 It will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, HASHEM of Hosts, and to keep the feast of booths. 
verse:14:17 It will be, that whoever of all the families of the earth doesn't go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, HASHEM of Hosts, on them there will be no rain. 
verse:14:18 If the family of Egypt doesn't go up, and doesn't come, neither will it rain on them. This will be the plague with which HASHEM will strike the nations that don't go up to keep the feast of booths. 
verse:14:19 This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that don't go up to keep the feast of booths. 
verse:14:20 In that day there will be on the bells of the horses, "HOLY TO THE HASHEM;" and the pots in HASHEM's house will be like the bowls before the altar. 
verse:14:21 Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to HASHEM of Hosts; and all those who sacrifice will come and take of them, and cook in them. In that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of HASHEM of Hosts.
portion:I Samuel 1:1 - 2:10
verse:1:1 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite: 
verse:1:2 and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. 
verse:1:3 This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to HASHEM of Hosts in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to HASHEM, were there. 
verse:1:4 When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: 
verse:1:5 but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but HASHEM had shut up her womb. 
verse:1:6 Her rival provoked her severely, to make her fret, because HASHEM had shut up her womb. 
verse:1:7 As he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of HASHEM, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and didn't eat. 
verse:1:8 Elkanah her husband said to her, "Hannah, why do you weep? Why don't you eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?"
verse:1:9 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of the temple of HASHEM. 
verse:1:10 She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to HASHEM, and wept bitterly. 
verse:1:11 She vowed a vow, and said, "HASHEM of Hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a boy, then I will give him to HASHEM all the days of his life, and no razor shall come on his head."
verse:1:12 It happened, as she continued praying before HASHEM, that Eli saw her mouth. 
verse:1:13 Now Hannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. 
verse:1:14 Eli said to her, "How long will you be drunken? Put away your wine from you."
verse:1:15 Hannah answered, "No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before HASHEM. 
verse:1:16 Don't count your handmaid for a wicked woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation."
verse:1:17 Then Eli answered, "Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him."
verse:1:18 She said, "Let your handmaid find favor in your sight." So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression wasn't sad any more. 
verse:1:19 They rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before HASHEM, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and HASHEM remembered her.
verse:1:20 It happened, when the time had come, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel, saying, "Because I have asked him of HASHEM."
verse:1:21 The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to HASHEM the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. 
verse:1:22 But Hannah didn't go up; for she said to her husband, "Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before HASHEM, and stay there forever."
verse:1:23 Elkanah her husband said to her, "Do what seems good to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may HASHEM establish his word."
So the woman waited and nursed her son, until she weaned him. 
verse:1:24 When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one efah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to HASHEM's house in Shiloh. The child was young. 
verse:1:25 They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli. 
verse:1:26 She said, "Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to HASHEM. 
verse:1:27 For this child I prayed; and HASHEM has given me my petition which I asked of him. 
verse:1:28 Therefore also I have granted him to HASHEM. As long as he lives he is granted to HASHEM." He worshiped HASHEM there.
verse:2:1 Hannah prayed, and said: "My heart exults in HASHEM! My horn is exalted in HASHEM. My mouth is enlarged over my enemies, because I rejoice in your salvation. 
verse:2:2 There is no one as holy as HASHEM, For there is no one besides you, nor is there any rock like our God.
verse:2:3 "Talk no more so exceeding proudly. Don't let arrogance come out of your mouth, For HASHEM is a God of knowledge. By him actions are weighed.
verse:2:4 "The bows of the mighty men are broken. Those who stumbled are armed with strength. 
verse:2:5 Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread. Those who were hungry are satisfied. Yes, the barren has borne seven. She who has many children languishes.
verse:2:6 "HASHEM kills, and makes alive. He brings down to Sheol, and brings up. 
verse:2:7 HASHEM makes poor, and makes rich. He brings low, he also lifts up. 
verse:2:8 He raises up the poor out of the dust. He lifts up the needy from the dunghill, To make them sit with princes, and inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth are HASHEM's. He has set the world on them. 
verse:2:9 He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; for no man shall prevail by strength. 
verse:2:10 Those who strive with HASHEM shall be broken to pieces. He will thunder against them in the sky.
"HASHEM will judge the ends of the earth. He will give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed." 
portion:I Samuel 11:14 - 12:22
verse:11:14 Then Samuel said to the people, "Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there." 
verse:11:15 All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before HASHEM in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices of peace offerings before HASHEM; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
verse:12:1 Samuel said to all Israel, "Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you. 
verse:12:2 Now, behold, the king walks before you; and I am old and gray-headed; and behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth to this day. 
verse:12:3 Here I am. Witness against me before HASHEM, and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind my eyes therewith? I will restore it to you."
verse:12:4 They said, "You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you taken anything of any man's hand."
verse:12:5 He said to them, "HASHEM is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand."
They said, "He is witness." 
verse:12:6 Samuel said to the people, "It is HASHEM who appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt. 
verse:12:7 Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before HASHEM concerning all the righteous acts of HASHEM, which he did to you and to your fathers.
verse:12:8 "When Jacob had come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to HASHEM, then HASHEM sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.
verse:12:9 "But they forgot HASHEM their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them. 
verse:12:10 They cried to HASHEM, and said, 'We have sinned, because we have forsaken HASHEM, and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.' 
verse:12:11 HASHEM sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and you lived in safety.
verse:12:12 "When you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, 'No, but a king shall reign over us;' when HASHEM your God was your king. 
verse:12:13 Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, and whom you have asked for: and behold, HASHEM has set a king over you. 
verse:12:14 If you will fear HASHEM, and serve him, and listen to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of HASHEM, then both you and also the king who reigns over you are followers of HASHEM your God. 
verse:12:15 But if you will not listen to the voice of HASHEM, but rebel against the commandment of HASHEM, then will the hand of HASHEM be against you, as it was against your fathers.
verse:12:16 "Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which HASHEM will do before your eyes. 
verse:12:17 Isn't it wheat harvest today? I will call to HASHEM, that he may send thunder and rain; and you shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of HASHEM, in asking for a king."
verse:12:18 So Samuel called to HASHEM; and HASHEM sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared HASHEM and Samuel.
verse:12:19 All the people said to Samuel, "Pray for your servants to HASHEM your God, that we not die; for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask us a king."
verse:12:20 Samuel said to the people, "Don't be afraid. You have indeed done all this evil; yet don't turn aside from following HASHEM, but serve HASHEM with all your heart. 
verse:12:21 Don't turn aside to go after vain things which can't profit nor deliver, for they are vain. 
verse:12:22 For HASHEM will not forsake his people for his great name's sake, because it has pleased HASHEM to make you a people to himself.
portion:I Samuel 20:18 - 20:4220:18} Then Jonathan said to him, "Tomorrow is the new moon: and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty. 
verse:20:19 When you have stayed three days, you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you hid yourself when this started, and shall remain by the stone Ezel. 
verse:20:20 I will shoot three arrows on its side, as though I shot at a mark. 
verse:20:21 Behold, I will send the boy, saying, 'Go, find the arrows!' If I tell the boy, 'Behold, the arrows are on this side of you. Take them;' then come; for there is peace to you and no hurt, as HASHEM lives. 
verse:20:22 But if I say this to the boy, 'Behold, the arrows are beyond you;' then go your way; for HASHEM has sent you away. 
verse:20:23 Concerning the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, HASHEM is between you and me forever."
verse:20:24 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon had come, the king sat him down to eat food. 
verse:20:25 The king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul's side: but David's place was empty. 
verse:20:26 Nevertheless Saul didn't say anything that day: for he thought, "Something has happened to him. He is not clean. Surely he is not clean."
verse:20:27 It happened on the next day after the new moon, the second day, that David's place was empty. Saul said to Jonathan his son, "Why doesn't the son of Jesse come to eat, neither yesterday, nor today?"
verse:20:28 Jonathan answered Saul, "David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem. 
verse:20:29 He said, 'Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city. My brother has commanded me to be there. Now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me go away and see my brothers.' Therefore he has not come to the king's table."
verse:20:30 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, "You son of a perverse rebellious woman, don't I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness? 
verse:20:31 For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Therefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die!"
verse:20:32 Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?"
verse:20:33 Saul cast his spear at him to strike him. By this Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death. 
verse:20:34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame. 
verse:20:35 It happened in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him. 
verse:20:36 He said to his boy, "Run, find now the arrows which I shoot." As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. 
verse:20:37 When the boy had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said, "Isn't the arrow beyond you?" 
verse:20:38 Jonathan cried after the boy, "Go fast! Hurry! Don't delay!" Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows, and came to his master. 
verse:20:39 But the boy didn't know anything. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter. 
verse:20:40 Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, "Go, carry them to the city."
verse:20:41 As soon as the boy was gone, David arose out of the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times. They kissed one another, and wept one with another, and David wept the most. 
verse:20:42 Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, because we have both sworn in the name of HASHEM, saying, 'HASHEM shall be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed, forever.'" 
portion:II Samuel 6:1 - 7:17
verse:6:1 David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. 
verse:6:2 David arose, and went with all the people who were with him, from Baale Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of HASHEM of Hosts who sits above the cherubim. 
verse:6:3 They set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart. 
verse:6:4 They brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark. 
verse:6:5 David and all the house of Israel played before HASHEM with all kinds of instruments made of fir wood, and with harps, and with stringed instruments, and with tambourines, and with castanets, and with cymbals. 
verse:6:6 When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached for the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the cattle stumbled. 
verse:6:7 The anger of HASHEM was kindled against Uzzah; and God struck him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God. 
verse:6:8 David was displeased, because HASHEM had broken forth on Uzzah; and he called that place Perez Uzzah, to this day. 
verse:6:9 David was afraid of HASHEM that day; and he said, "How shall the ark of HASHEM come to me?" 
verse:6:10 So David would not move the ark of HASHEM to be with him in the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. 
verse:6:11 The ark of HASHEM remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months: and HASHEM blessed Obed-Edom, and all his house. 
verse:6:12 It was told king David, saying, "HASHEM has blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God."
David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom into the city of David with joy. 
verse:6:13 It was so, that, when those who bore the ark of HASHEM had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf. 
verse:6:14 David danced before HASHEM with all his might; and David was clothed in a linen ephod. 
verse:6:15 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of HASHEM with shouting, and with the sound of the shofar. 
verse:6:16 It was so, as the ark of HASHEM came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before HASHEM; and she despised him in her heart. 
verse:6:17 They brought in the ark of HASHEM, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before HASHEM. 
verse:6:18 When David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of HASHEM of Hosts. 
verse:6:19 He gave to all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to everyone a portion of bread, dates, and raisins. So all the people departed everyone to his house. 
verse:6:20 Then David returned to bless his household. Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, "How glorious the king of Israel was today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!"
verse:6:21 David said to Michal, "It was before HASHEM, who chose me above your father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of HASHEM, over Israel. Therefore will I celebrate before HASHEM. 
verse:6:22 I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in my own sight. But of the handmaids of whom you have spoken, they shall honor me." 
verse:6:23 Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.
verse:7:1 It happened, when the king lived in his house, and HASHEM had given him rest from all his enemies all around, 
verse:7:2 that the king said to Nathan the prophet, "See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains."
verse:7:3 Nathan said to the king, "Go, do all that is in your heart; for HASHEM is with you."
verse:7:4 It happened the same night, that the word of HASHEM came to Nathan, saying, 
verse:7:5 "Go and tell my servant David, 'Thus says HASHEM, "Shall you build me a house for me to dwell in? 
verse:7:6 For I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle. 
verse:7:7 In all places in which I have walked with all the children of Israel, did I say a word to any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, 'Why have you not built me a house of cedar?'"' 
verse:7:8 Now therefore you shall tell my servant David this, 'Thus says HASHEM of Hosts, "I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people, over Israel. 
verse:7:9 I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth. 
verse:7:10 I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first, 
verse:7:11 and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will cause you to rest from all your enemies. Moreover HASHEM tells you that HASHEM will make you a house. 
verse:7:12 When your days are fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. 
verse:7:13 He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. 
verse:7:14 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men; 
verse:7:15 but my loving kindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you. 
verse:7:16 Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before you. Your throne shall be established forever."'" 
verse:7:17 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
portion:II Samuel 22:1-51
verse:22:1 David spoke to HASHEM the words of this song in the day that HASHEM delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul: 
verse:22:2 and he said, "HASHEM is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine; 
verse:22:3 God, my rock, in him I will take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge. My savior, you save me from violence. 
verse:22:4 I will call on HASHEM, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from my enemies. 
verse:22:5 For the waves of death surrounded me. The floods of ungodliness made me afraid. 
verse:22:6 The cords of [Sheol were around me. The snares of death caught me. 
verse:22:7 In my distress I called on HASHEM. Yes, I called to my God. He heard my voice out of his temple. My cry came into his ears. 
verse:22:8 Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken, because he was angry. 
verse:22:9 Smoke went up out of his nostrils. Fire out of his mouth devoured. Coals were kindled by it. 
verse:22:10 He bowed the heavens also, and came down. Thick darkness was under his feet. 
verse:22:11 He rode on a cherub, and flew. Yes, he was seen on the wings of the wind. 
verse:22:12 He made darkness pavilions around himself: gathering of waters, and thick clouds of the skies. 
verse:22:13 At the brightness before him, coals of fire were kindled. 
verse:22:14 HASHEM thundered from heaven. The Most High uttered his voice. 
verse:22:15 He sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and confused them. 
verse:22:16 Then the channels of the sea appeared. The foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of HASHEM, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils. 
verse:22:17 He sent from on high and he took me. He drew me out of many waters. 
verse:22:18 He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me. 
verse:22:19 They came on me in the day of my calamity, but HASHEM was my support. 
verse:22:20 He also brought me out into a large place. He delivered me, because he delighted in me. 
verse:22:21 HASHEM rewarded me according to my righteousness. He rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands. 
verse:22:22 For I have kept the ways of HASHEM, and have not wickedly departed from my God. 
verse:22:23 For all his ordinances were before me. As for his statutes, I did not depart from them. 
verse:22:24 I was also perfect toward him. I kept myself from my iniquity. 
verse:22:25 Therefore HASHEM has rewarded me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his eyesight. 
verse:22:26 With the merciful you will show yourself merciful. With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect. 
verse:22:27 With the pure you will show yourself pure. With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd. 
verse:22:28 You will save the afflicted people, But your eyes are on the haughty, that you may bring them down. 
verse:22:29 For you are my lamp, HASHEM. HASHEM will light up my darkness. 
verse:22:30 For by you, I run against a troop. By my God, I leap over a wall. 
verse:22:31 As for God, his way is perfect. The word of HASHEM is tested. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him. 
verse:22:32 For who is God, besides HASHEM? Who is a rock, besides our God? 
verse:22:33 God is my strong fortress. He makes my way perfect. 
verse:22:34 He makes his feet like hinds' feet, and sets me on my high places. 
verse:22:35 He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of brass. 
verse:22:36 You have also given me the shield of your salvation. Your gentleness has made me great. 
verse:22:37 You have enlarged my steps under me. My feet have not slipped. 
verse:22:38 I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them. I didn't turn again until they were consumed. 
verse:22:39 I have consumed them, and struck them through, so that they can't arise. Yes, they have fallen under my feet. 
verse:22:40 For you have armed me with strength for the battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me. 
verse:22:41 You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me. 
verse:22:42 They looked, but there was none to save; even to HASHEM, but he didn't answer them. 
verse:22:43 Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth. I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad. 
verse:22:44 You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people. You have kept me to be the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known will serve me. 
verse:22:45 The foreigners will submit themselves to me. As soon as they hear of me, they will obey me. 
verse:22:46 The foreigners will fade away, and will come trembling out of their close places. 
verse:22:47 HASHEM lives! Blessed be my rock! Exalted be God, the rock of my salvation, 
verse:22:48 even the God who executes vengeance for me, who brings down peoples under me, 
verse:22:49 who brings me away from my enemies. Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me. You deliver me from the violent man. 
verse:22:50 Therefore I will give thanks to you, HASHEM, among the nations. Will sing praises to your name. 
verse:22:51 He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness to his anointed, to David and to his seed, forevermore." 
portion:Jeremiah 1:1 - 2:3
verse:1:1 The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: 
verse:1:2 to whom the word of HASHEM came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. 
verse:1:3 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month. 
verse:1:4 Now the word of HASHEM came to me, saying, 
verse:1:5 "Before I formed you in the belly, I knew you. Before you came forth out of the womb, I sanctified you. I have appointed you a prophet to the nations." 
verse:1:6 Then I said, "Ah, my Lord HASHEM! Behold, I don't know how to speak; for I am a child."
verse:1:7 But HASHEM said to me, "Don't say, 'I am a child;' for to whoever I shall send you, you shall go, and whatever I shall command you, you shall speak. 
verse:1:8 Don't be afraid because of them; for I am with you to deliver you," says HASHEM. 
verse:1:9 Then HASHEM put forth his hand, and touched my mouth; and HASHEM said to me, "Behold, I have put my words in your mouth. 
verse:1:10 Behold, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant." 
verse:1:11 Moreover the word of HASHEM came to me, saying, "Jeremiah, what do you see?"
I said, "I see a branch of an almond tree."
verse:1:12 Then HASHEM said to me, "You have seen well; for I watch over my word to perform it."
verse:1:13 The word of HASHEM came to me the second time, saying, "What do you see?"
I said, "I see a boiling caldron; and it is tipping away from the north."
verse:1:14 Then HASHEM said to me, "Out of the north evil will break out on all the inhabitants of the land. 
verse:1:15 For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north," says HASHEM; "and they shall come, and they shall each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah. 
verse:1:16 I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.
verse:1:17 "You therefore put your belt on your waist, arise, and speak to them all that I command you. Don't be dismayed at them, lest I dismay you before them. 
verse:1:18 For, behold, I have made you this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land. 
verse:1:19 They will fight against you; but they will not prevail against you; for I am with you," says HASHEM, "to deliver you."
verse:2:1 The word of HASHEM came to me, saying, 
verse:2:2 "Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, 'Thus says HASHEM, "I remember for you the kindness of your youth, the love of your weddings; how you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown. 
verse:2:3 Israel was holiness to HASHEM, the first fruits of his increase. All who devour him shall be held guilty. Evil shall come on them,"' says HASHEM."
portion:Jeremiah 2:4 - 28; 3:42:4} Hear the word of HASHEM, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel! 
verse:2:5 Thus says HASHEM, "What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me, that they have gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain? 
verse:2:6 Neither did they say, 'Where is HASHEM who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none passed through, and where no man lived?' 
verse:2:7 I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat its fruit and its goodness; but when you entered, you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination. 
verse:2:8 The priests didn't say, 'Where is HASHEM?' and those who handle the law didn't know me. The rulers also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.
verse:2:9 "Therefore I will yet contend with you," says HASHEM, "and I will contend with your children's children. 
verse:2:10 For pass over to the islands of Kittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider diligently; and see if there has been such a thing. 
verse:2:11 Has a nation changed its gods, which really are no gods? But my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.
verse:2:12 "Be astonished, you heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid. Be very desolate," says HASHEM. 
verse:2:13 "For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the spring of living waters, and cut them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water. 
verse:2:14 Is Israel a servant? Is he a native-born slave? Why has he become a prey? 
verse:2:15 The young lions have roared at him, and yelled. They have made his land waste. His cities are burned up, without inhabitant.

verse:2:18 Now what have you to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? Or what have you to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?
verse:2:19 "Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backsliding shall reprove you. Know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter, that you have forsaken HASHEM your God, and that my fear is not in you," says the Lord, HASHEM of Hosts. 
verse:2:20 "For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bonds; and you said, 'I will not serve;' for on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed yourself, playing the prostitute. 
verse:2:21 Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed. How then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me? 
verse:2:22 For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before me," says HASHEM GOD.
verse:2:23 "How can you say, 'I am not defiled. I have not gone after the Baals'? See your way in the valley. Know what you have done. You are a swift dromedary traversing her ways; 
verse:2:24 a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind in her desire. When she is in heat, who can turn her away? All those who seek her will not weary themselves. In her month, they will find her.
verse:2:25 "Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst. But you said, 'It is in vain. No, for I have loved strangers, and I will go after them.'

verse:2:27 who tell wood, 'You are my father;' and a stone, 'You have brought me out:' for they have turned their back to me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, 'Arise, and save us.'
verse:2:28 "But where are your gods that you have made for yourselves? Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah.

verse:7:23 but this thing I commanded them, saying, Listen to my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people; and walk in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you. 
verse:7:24 But they didn't listen nor turn their ear, but walked in their own counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward. 
verse:7:25 Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them: 
verse:7:26 yet they didn't listen to me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff: they did worse than their fathers. 
verse:7:27 You shall speak all these words to them; but they will not listen to you: you shall also call to them; but they will not answer you. 
verse:7:28 You shall tell them, This is the nation that has not listened to the voice of HASHEM their God, nor received instruction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth. 
verse:7:29 Cut off your hair, and throw it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights; for HASHEM has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath. 
verse:7:30 For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight, says HASHEM: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it. 
verse:7:31 They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I didn't command, nor did it come into my mind. 
verse:7:32 Therefore, behold, the days come, says HASHEM, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter: for they shall bury in Topheth, until there is no place to bury. 
verse:7:33 The dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth; and none shall frighten them away. 
verse:7:34 Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land shall become a waste.
verse:8:1 At that time, says HASHEM, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves; 
verse:8:2 and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the army of the sky, which they have loved, and which they have served, and after which they have walked, and which they have sought, and which they have worshiped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried, they shall be for dung on the surface of the earth. 
verse:8:3 Death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places where I have driven them, says HASHEM of Hosts.
verse:9:22 Thus says HASHEM, Don't let the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, don't let the rich man glory in his riches; 
verse:9:23 but let him who glories glory in this, that he has understanding, and knows me, that I am HASHEM who exercises loving kindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, says HASHEM.
portion:Jeremiah 16:19 - 17:14
verse:16:19 HASHEM, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge in the day of affliction, to you shall the nations come from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies, vanity and things in which there is no profit. 
verse:16:20 Shall a man make to himself gods, which yet are no gods? 
verse:16:21 Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know, this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is HASHEM.
verse:17:1 The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is engraved on the tablet of their heart, and on the horns of your altars; 
verse:17:2 while their children remember their altars and their Asherim by the green trees on the high hills. 
verse:17:3 My mountain in the field, I will give your substance and all your treasures for a spoil, and your high places, because of sin, throughout all your borders. 
verse:17:4 You, even of yourself, shall discontinue from your heritage that I gave you; and I will cause you to serve your enemies in the land which you don't know: for you have kindled a fire in my anger which shall burn forever. 
verse:17:5 Thus says HASHEM: Cursed is the man who trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart departs from HASHEM. 
verse:17:6 For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good comes, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt land and not inhabited. 
verse:17:7 Blessed is the man who trusts in HASHEM, and whose trust HASHEM is. 
verse:17:8 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, who spreads out its roots by the river, and shall not fear when heat comes, but its leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit. 
verse:17:9 The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is exceedingly corrupt: who can know it? 
verse:17:10 I, HASHEM, search the mind, I try the heart, even to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings. 
verse:17:11 As the partridge that sits on eggs which she has not laid, so is he who gets riches, and not by right; in the midst of his days they shall leave him, and at his end he shall be a fool. 
verse:17:12 A glorious throne, set on high from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary. 
verse:17:13 HASHEM, the hope of Israel, all who forsake you shall be disappointed. Those who depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken HASHEM, the spring of living waters. 
verse:17:14 Heal me, O HASHEM, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for you are my praise.
portion:Jeremiah 32:6 - 32:27
verse:32:6 Jeremiah said, The word of HASHEM came to me, saying, 
verse:32:7 Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you, saying, Buy my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is yours to buy it. 
verse:32:8 So Hanamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of HASHEM, and said to me, Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of HASHEM. 
verse:32:9 I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle's son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver. 
verse:32:10 I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances. 
verse:32:11 So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, containing the terms and conditions, and that which was open; 
verse:32:12 and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses who subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard. 
verse:32:13 I commanded Baruch before them, saying, 
verse:32:14 Thus says HASHEM of Hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days. 
verse:32:15 For thus says HASHEM of Hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land. 
verse:32:16 Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to HASHEM, saying, 
verse:32:17 Ah HASHEM GOD! Behold, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard for you, 
verse:32:18 who show loving kindness to thousands, and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; the great, the mighty God, HASHEM of Hosts is his name; 
verse:32:19 great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings: 
verse:32:20 who performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, both in Israel and among other men; and made yourself a name, as in this day; 
verse:32:21 and brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror; 
verse:32:22 and gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; 
verse:32:23 and they came in, and possessed it, but they didn't obey your voice, neither walked in your law; they have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do: therefore you have caused all this evil to come on them. 
verse:32:24 Behold, the mounds, they have come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Kasdim who fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what you have spoken has happened; and behold, you see it. 
verse:32:25 You have said to me, HASHEM GOD, Buy the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Kasdim. 
verse:32:26 Then came the word of HASHEM to Jeremiah, saying, 
verse:32:27 Behold, I am HASHEM, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?
portion:Jeremiah 34:8 - 34:22; 33:25 - 33:26
verse:34:8 The word that came to Jeremiah from HASHEM, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them; 
verse:34:9 that every man should let his male servant, and every man his female servant, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that none should make bondservants of them, of a Jew his brother. 
verse:34:10 All the princes and all the people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant, that everyone should let his male servant, and everyone his female servant, go free, that none should make bondservants of them any more; they obeyed, and let them go: 
verse:34:11 but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids. 
verse:34:12 Therefore the word of HASHEM came to Jeremiah from HASHEM, saying, 
verse:34:13 Thus says HASHEM, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying, 
verse:34:14 At the end of seven years you shall let go every man his brother who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to you, and has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you: but your fathers didn't listen to me, neither inclined their ear. 
verse:34:15 You had now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor; and you had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name: 
verse:34:16 but you turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom you had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and you brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids. 
verse:34:17 Therefore thus says HASHEM: you have not listened to me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim to you a liberty, says HASHEM, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth. 
verse:34:18 I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts; 
verse:34:19 the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf; 
verse:34:20 I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life; and their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the sky, and to the animals of the earth. 
verse:34:21 Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, who have gone away from you. 
verse:34:22 Behold, I will command, says HASHEM, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.
verse:33:25 Thus says HASHEM: If my covenant of day and night fails, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth; 
verse:33:26 then will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have mercy on them.
portion:Jeremiah 46:13 - 46:28
verse:46:13 The word that HASHEM spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon should come and strike the land of Egypt. 
verse:46:14 Declare in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes: say, Stand forth, and prepare; for the sword has devoured around you. 
verse:46:15 Why are your strong ones swept away? they didn't stand, because HASHEM pushed them. 
verse:46:16 He made many to stumble, yes, they fell one on another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our birth, from the oppressing sword. 
verse:46:17 They cried there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he has let the appointed time pass by. 
verse:46:18 As I live, says the King, whose name is HASHEM of Hosts, surely like Tabor among the mountains, and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he come. 
verse:46:19 You daughter who dwells in Egypt, furnish yourself to go into captivity; for Memphis shall become a desolation, and shall be burnt up, without inhabitant. 
verse:46:20 Egypt is a very beautiful heifer; but destruction out of the north has come, it has come. 
verse:46:21 Also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall; for they also are turned back, they are fled away together, they didn't stand: for the day of their calamity has come on them, the time of their visitation. 
verse:46:22 The sound of it shall go like the serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as wood cutters. 
verse:46:23 They shall cut down her forest, says HASHEM, though it can't be searched; because they are more than the locusts, and are innumerable. 
verse:46:24 The daughter of Egypt shall be disappointed; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north. 
verse:46:25 HASHEM of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Behold, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with her gods, and her kings; even Pharaoh, and those who trust in him: 
verse:46:26 and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants; and afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, says HASHEM. 
verse:46:27 But don't you be afraid, Jacob my servant, neither be dismayed, Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid. 
verse:46:28 Don't you be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says HASHEM; for I am with you: for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you; but I will not make a full end of you, but I will correct you in measure, and will in no way leave you unpunished.
portion:Joshua 1:1 - 1:18
verse:1:1 Now it happened after the death of Moses the servant of HASHEM, that HASHEM spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' servant, saying, 
verse:1:2 "Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you, and all this people, to the land which I give to them, even to the children of Israel. 
verse:1:3 I have given you every place that the sole of your foot will tread on, as I told Moses. 
verse:1:4 From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border. 
verse:1:5 No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not fail you nor forsake you.
verse:1:6 "Be strong and courageous; for you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. 
verse:1:7 Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded you. Don't turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go. 
verse:1:8 This scroll of the Torah shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success. 
verse:1:9 Haven't I commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed: for HASHEM your God is with you wherever you go."
verse:1:10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 
verse:1:11 "Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, 'Prepare food; for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which HASHEM your God gives you to possess it.'"
verse:1:12 Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying, 
verse:1:13 "Remember the word which Moses the servant of HASHEM commanded you, saying, 'HASHEM your God gives you rest, and will give you this land. 
verse:1:14 Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock, shall live in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but you shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them 
verse:1:15 until HASHEM has given your brothers rest, as he has given you, and they have also possessed the land which HASHEM your God gives them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of HASHEM gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.'"
verse:1:16 They answered Joshua, saying, "All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. 
verse:1:17 Just as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you. Only may HASHEM your God be with you, as he was with Moses. 
verse:1:18 Whoever rebels against your commandment, and doesn't listen to your words in all that you command him, he shall be put to death. Only be strong and courageous."
portion:Joshua 2:1 - 2:24
verse:2:1 Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out of Shittim as spies, saying, "Go, view the land, including Jericho." They went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and slept there.
verse:2:2 The king of Jericho was told, "Behold, men of the children of Israel came in here tonight to spy out the land."
verse:2:3 The king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, "Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered into your house; for they have come to spy out all the land."
verse:2:4 The woman took the two men and hid them. Then she said, "Yes, the men came to me, but I didn't know where they came from. 
verse:2:5 It happened about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out. Where the men went, I don't know. Pursue them quickly; for you will overtake them." 
verse:2:6 But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof. 
verse:2:7 The men pursued them the way to the Jordan to the fords: and as soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate. 
verse:2:8 Before they had laid down, she came up to them on the roof; 
verse:2:9 and she said to the men, "I know that HASHEM has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you. 
verse:2:10 For we have heard how HASHEM dried up the water of the Sea of Suf before you, when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you utterly destroyed. 
verse:2:11 As soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for HASHEM your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath. 
verse:2:12 Now therefore, please swear to me by HASHEM, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you also will deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a true token; 
verse:2:13 and that you will save alive my father, my mother, my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death."
verse:2:14 The men said to her, "Our life for yours, if you don't talk about this business of ours; and it shall be, when HASHEM gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you."
verse:2:15 Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was on the side of the wall, and she lived on the wall. 
verse:2:16 She said to them, "Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers find you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned. Afterward, you may go your way."
verse:2:17 The men said to her, "We will be guiltless of this your oath which you have made us to swear. 
verse:2:18 Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you used to let us down. You shall gather to yourself into the house your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father's household. 
verse:2:19 It shall be that whoever goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be on his head, and we will be guiltless. Whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand is on him. 
verse:2:20 But if you talk about this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless of your oath which you have made us to swear."
verse:2:21 She said, "According to your words, so be it." She sent them away, and they departed. She tied the scarlet line in the window.
verse:2:22 They went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had returned. The pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but didn't find them. 
verse:2:23 Then the two men returned, descended from the mountain, passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had happened to them. 
verse:2:24 They said to Joshua, "Truly HASHEM has delivered into our hands all the land. Moreover, all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us."
portion:Joshua 5:2 - 6:1
verse:5:2 At that time, HASHEM said to Joshua, "Make flint knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time." 
verse:5:3 Joshua made himself flint knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins. 
verse:5:4 This is the reason Joshua circumcised: all the people who came out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt. 
verse:5:5 For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised. 
verse:5:6 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, even the men of war who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they didn't listen to the voice of HASHEM. HASHEM swore to them that he wouldn't let them see the land which HASHEM swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
verse:5:7 Their children, whom he raised up in their place, were circumcised by Joshua; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way. 
verse:5:8 It happened, when they were done circumcising all the nation, that they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed.
verse:5:9 HASHEM said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you." Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, to this day. 
verse:5:10 The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal. They kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho. 
verse:5:11 They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover, in the same day. 
verse:5:12 The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce of the land. The children of Israel didn't have manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
verse:5:13 It happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him, and said to him, "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"
verse:5:14 He said, "No; but I have come now as commander of HASHEM's army."
Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said to him, "What does my lord say to his servant?"
verse:5:15 The prince of HASHEM's army said to Joshua, "Take your shoes off of your feet; for the place on which you stand is holy." Joshua did so.
verse:6:1 Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel. No one went out, and no one came in.
portion:Judges 4:4 - 5:31
verse:4:4 Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time. 
verse:4:5 She lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. 
verse:4:6 She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, "Hasn't HASHEM, the God of Israel, commanded, 'Go and draw to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? 
verse:4:7 I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.'"
verse:4:8 Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go."
verse:4:9 She said, "I will surely go with you: nevertheless, the journey that you take shall not be for your honor; for HASHEM will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman." Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
verse:4:10 Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him. 
verse:4:11 Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh. 
verse:4:12 They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor. 
verse:4:13 Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.
verse:4:14 Deborah said to Barak, "Go; for this is the day in which HASHEM has delivered Sisera into your hand. Hasn't HASHEM gone out before you?" So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him. 
verse:4:15 HASHEM confused Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet. 
verse:4:16 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.
verse:4:17 However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 
verse:4:18 Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, "Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don't be afraid." He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.
verse:4:19 He said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty."
She opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
verse:4:20 He said to her, "Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man comes and inquires of you, and says, 'Is there any man here?' that you shall say, 'No.'"
verse:4:21 Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died. 
verse:4:22 Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, "Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek." He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples. 
verse:4:23 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel. 
verse:4:24 The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
verse:5:1 Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying, 
verse:5:2 "Because the leaders took the lead in Israel, because the people offered themselves willingly, be blessed, HASHEM!

verse:5:6 "In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied. The travelers walked through byways. 
verse:5:7 The rulers ceased in Israel. They ceased until I, Deborah, arose; Until I arose a mother in Israel. 
verse:5:8 They chose new gods. Then war was in the gates. Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel? 
verse:5:9 My heart is toward the governors of Israel, who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless HASHEM!
verse:5:10 "Speak, you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit on rich carpets, and you who walk by the way. 
verse:5:11 Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water, there they will rehearse the righteous acts of HASHEM, the righteous acts of his rule in Israel.
"Then the people of HASHEM went down to the gates. 
verse:5:12 'Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, utter a song! Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you son of Abinoam.'
verse:5:13 "Then a remnant of the nobles and the people came down. HASHEM came down for me against the mighty. 
verse:5:14 Those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim, after you, Benjamin, among your peoples. Governors come down out of Machir. Those who handle the marshal's staff came out of Zebulun. 
verse:5:15 The princes of Issachar were with Deborah. As was Issachar, so was Barak. They rushed into the valley at his feet. By the watercourses of Reuben, there were great resolves of heart. 
verse:5:16 Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, To hear the whistling for the flocks? At the watercourses of Reuben There were great searchings of heart. 
verse:5:17 Gilead lived beyond the Jordan. Why did Dan remain in ships? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, and lived by his creeks. 
verse:5:18 Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the deaths; Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.
verse:5:19 "The kings came and fought, then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo. They took no plunder of silver.

verse:5:28 "Through the window she looked out, and cried: Sisera's mother looked through the lattice. 'Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why do the wheels of his chariots wait?'

verse:5:31 "So let all your enemies perish, HASHEM, but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength."

portion:Judges 11:1 - 11:33
verse:11:1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a prostitute: and Gilead became the father of Jephthah. 
verse:11:2 Gilead's wife bore him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said to him, "You shall not inherit in our father's house; for you are the son of another woman." 
verse:11:3 Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and lived in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with him. 
verse:11:4 It happened after a while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel. 
verse:11:5 It was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob; 
verse:11:6 and they said to Jephthah, "Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon."
verse:11:7 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "Didn't you hate me, and drive me out of my father's house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?"
verse:11:8 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "Therefore we have turned again to you now, that you may go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon; and you shall be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
verse:11:9 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "If you bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and HASHEM deliver them before me, shall I be your head?"
verse:11:10 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "HASHEM shall be witness between us; surely according to your word so will we do."
verse:11:11 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them: and Jephthah spoke all his words before HASHEM in Mizpah.
verse:11:12 Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, "What have you to do with me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?"
verse:11:13 The king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, "Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan: now therefore restore that territory again peaceably."
verse:11:14 Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon; 
verse:11:15 and he said to him, "Thus says Jephthah: Israel didn't take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon, 
verse:11:16 but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Sea of Suf, and came to Kadesh; 
verse:11:17 then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Please let me pass through your land;' but the king of Edom didn't listen. In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab; but he would not: and Israel stayed in Kadesh. 
verse:11:18 Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they didn't come within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab. 
verse:11:19 Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, 'Please let us pass through your land to my place.' 
verse:11:20 But Sihon didn't trust Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. 
verse:11:21 HASHEM, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country. 
verse:11:22 They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan. 
verse:11:23 So now HASHEM, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess them? 
verse:11:24 Won't you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whoever HASHEM our God has dispossessed from before us, them will we possess. 
verse:11:25 Now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them? 
verse:11:26 While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; why didn't you recover them within that time? 
verse:11:27 I therefore have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me. HASHEM, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon."
verse:11:28 However the king of the children of Ammon didn't listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent him. 
verse:11:29 Then the Spirit of HASHEM came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.
verse:11:30 Jephthah vowed a vow to HASHEM, and said, "If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand, 
verse:11:31 then it shall be, that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be HASHEM's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering."
verse:11:32 So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and HASHEM delivered them into his hand. 
verse:11:33 He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
portion:Judges 13:2 - 13:25
verse:13:2 There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and didn't bear. 
verse:13:3 The angel of HASHEM appeared to the woman, and said to her, "See now, you are barren, and don't bear; but you shall conceive, and bear a son. 
verse:13:4 Now therefore please beware and drink no wine nor strong drink, and don't eat any unclean thing: 
verse:13:5 for, behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines."
verse:13:6 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, "A man of God came to me, and his face was like the face of the angel of God, very awesome; and I didn't ask him where he was from, neither did he tell me his name: 
verse:13:7 but he said to me, 'Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.'"
verse:13:8 Then Manoah entreated HASHEM, and said, "Oh, Lord, please let the man of God whom you did send come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child who shall be born."
verse:13:9 God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah, her husband, wasn't with her. 
verse:13:10 The woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said to him, "Behold, the man has appeared to me, who came to me that day."
verse:13:11 Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, "Are you the man who spoke to the woman?"
He said, "I am."
verse:13:12 Manoah said, "Now let your words happen. What shall the child's way of life and mission be?"
verse:13:13 The angel of HASHEM said to Manoah, "Of all that I said to the woman let her beware. 
verse:13:14 She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe."
verse:13:15 Manoah said to the angel of HASHEM, "Please, let us detain you, that we may make a young goat ready for you."
verse:13:16 The angel of HASHEM said to Manoah, "Though you detain me, I won't eat of your bread; and if you will prepare a burnt offering, you must offer it to HASHEM." For Manoah didn't know that he was the angel of HASHEM.
verse:13:17 Manoah said to the angel of HASHEM, "What is your name, that when your words happen, we may honor you?"
verse:13:18 The angel of HASHEM said to him, "Why do you ask about my name, since it is wonderful?"
verse:13:19 So Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering, and offered it on the rock to HASHEM. Then the angel did a wonderful thing as Manoah and his wife looked on. 
verse:13:20 For it happened, when the flame went up toward the sky from off the altar, that the angel of HASHEM ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground. 
verse:13:21 But the angel of HASHEM didn't appear to Manoah or to his wife any more. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of HASHEM. 
verse:13:22 Manoah said to his wife, "We shall surely die, because we have seen God."
verse:13:23 But his wife said to him, "If HASHEM were pleased to kill us, he wouldn't have received a burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand, neither would he have shown us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these." 
verse:13:24 The woman bore a son, and named him Samson: and the child grew, and HASHEM blessed him. 
verse:13:25 The Spirit of HASHEM began to move him in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
portion:Isaiah 1:1 - 1:27
verse:1:1 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. 
verse:1:2 Hear, heavens, and listen, earth; for HASHEM has spoken: "I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me. 
verse:1:3 The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib; but Israel doesn't know, my people don't consider." 
verse:1:4 Ah sinful nation, a people loaded with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children who deal corruptly! They have forsaken HASHEM. They have despised the Holy One of Israel. They are estranged and backward. 
verse:1:5 Why should you be beaten more, that you revolt more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. 
verse:1:6 From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it: wounds, welts, and open sores. They haven't been closed, neither bandaged, neither soothed with oil. 
verse:1:7 Your country is desolate. Your cities are burned with fire. Strangers devour your land in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers. 
verse:1:8 The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a besieged city. 
verse:1:9 Unless HASHEM of Hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we would have been as Sodom; we would have been like Gomorrah. 
verse:1:10 Hear the word of HASHEM, you rulers of Sodom! Listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah! 
verse:1:11 "What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?," says HASHEM. "I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed animals. I don't delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of male goats. 
verse:1:12 When you come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts? 
verse:1:13 Bring no more vain offerings. Incense is an abomination to me; new moons, Sabbaths, and convocations: I can't bear with evil assemblies. 
verse:1:14 My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts. They are a burden to me. I am weary of bearing them. 
verse:1:15 When you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you. Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood. 
verse:1:16 Wash yourselves, make yourself clean. Put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes. Cease to do evil. 
verse:1:17 Learn to do well. Seek justice. Relieve the oppressed. Judge the fatherless. Plead for the widow."
verse:1:18 "Come now, and let us reason together," says HASHEM: "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. 
verse:1:19 If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land; 
verse:1:20 but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of HASHEM has spoken it."
verse:1:21 How the faithful city has become a prostitute! She was full of justice; righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers. 
verse:1:22 Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water. 
verse:1:23 Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves. Everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards. They don't judge the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come to them. 
verse:1:24 Therefore my Lord, HASHEM of Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, says: "Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries, and avenge myself of my enemies; 
verse:1:25 and I will turn my hand on you, thoroughly purge away your dross, and will take away all your tin. 
verse:1:26 I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called 'The city of righteousness, a faithful town.' 
verse:1:27 Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.
portion:Isaiah 6:1 - 7:6; 9:5 - 9:6
verse:6:1 In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw my Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. 
verse:6:2 Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew. 
verse:6:3 One called to another, and said, "Holy, holy, holy, is HASHEM of Hosts! The whole earth is full of his glory!"
verse:6:4 The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. 
verse:6:5 Then I said, "Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, HASHEM of Hosts!"
verse:6:6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar. 
verse:6:7 He touched my mouth with it, and said, "Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven."
verse:6:8 I heard my Lord's voice, saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?"
Then I said, "Here I am. Send me!"
verse:6:9 He said, "Go, and tell this people, 'You hear indeed, but don't understand; and you see indeed, but don't perceive.' 
verse:6:10 Make the heart of this people fat. Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed."
verse:6:11 Then I said, "My Lord, how long?"
He answered, "Until cities are waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land becomes utterly waste, 
verse:6:12 And HASHEM has removed men far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land. 
verse:6:13 If there is a tenth left in it, that also will in turn be consumed: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains when they are felled; so the holy seed is its stock."
verse:7:1 It happened in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it. 
verse:7:2 It was told the house of David, saying, "Syria is allied with Ephraim." His heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind. 
verse:7:3 Then HASHEM said to Isaiah, "Go out now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller's field. 
verse:7:4 Tell him, 'Be careful, and keep calm. Don't be afraid, neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking torches, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. 
verse:7:5 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have plotted evil against you, saying, 
verse:7:6 "Let's go up against Judah, and tear it apart, and let's divide it among ourselves, and set up a king in its midst, even the son of Tabeel."
verse:9:5 For to us a child is born. To us a son is given; and the government will be on his shoulders. His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. 
verse:9:6 Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, on the throne of David, and on his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from that time on, even forever. The zeal of HASHEM of Hosts will perform this. 
portion:Isaiah 10:32 - 12:6
verse:10:32 This very day he will halt at Nob. He shakes his hand at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. 
verse:10:33 Behold, my Lord, HASHEM of Hosts, will lop the boughs with terror. The tall will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low. 
verse:10:34 He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.
verse:11:1 A shoot will come out of the stock of Jesse, and a branch out of his roots will bear fruit. 
verse:11:2 The Spirit of HASHEM will rest on him: the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of HASHEM. 
verse:11:3 His delight will be in the fear of HASHEM. He will not judge by the sight of his eyes, neither decide by the hearing of his ears; 
verse:11:4 but with righteousness he will judge the poor, and decide with equity for the humble of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips he will kill the wicked. 
verse:11:5 Righteousness will be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt of his waist. 
verse:11:6 The wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the young goat; The calf, the young lion, and the fattened calf together; and a little child will lead them. 
verse:11:7 The cow and the bear will graze. Their young ones will lie down together. The lion will eat straw like the ox. 
verse:11:8 The nursing child will play near a cobra's hole, and the weaned child will put his hand on the viper's den. 
verse:11:9 They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of HASHEM, as the waters cover the sea.
verse:11:10 It will happen in that day that the nations will seek the root of Jesse, who stands as a banner of the peoples; and his resting place will be glorious. 
verse:11:11 It will happen in that day that my Lord will set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. 
verse:11:12 He will set up a banner for the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. 
verse:11:13 The envy also of Ephraim will depart, and those who persecute Judah will be cut off. Ephraim won't envy Judah, and Judah won't persecute Ephraim. 
verse:11:14 They will fly down on the shoulders of the Philistines on the west. Together they will plunder the children of the east. They will extend their power over Edom and Moab, and the children of Ammon will obey them. 
verse:11:15 HASHEM will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his scorching wind he will wave his hand over the River, and will split it into seven streams, and cause men to march over in sandals. 
verse:11:16 There will be a highway for the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, like there was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
verse:12:1 In that day you will say, "I will give thanks to you, HASHEM; for though you were angry with me, your anger has turned away and you comfort me. 
verse:12:2 Behold, God is my salvation. I will trust, and will not be afraid; for HASHEM, HASHEM, is my strength and song; and he has become my salvation [yeshu`ah]." 
verse:12:3 Therefore with joy you will draw water out of the wells of salvation [yeshu`ah]. 
verse:12:4 In that day you will say, "Give thanks to HASHEM! Call on his name. Declare his doings among the peoples. Proclaim that his name is exalted! 
verse:12:5 Sing to HASHEM, for he has done excellent things! Let this be known in all the earth! 
verse:12:6 Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion; for the Holy One of Israel is great in the midst of you!"
portion:Isaiah 27:6 - 28:13; 29:22 - 29:23
verse:27:6 In days to come, Jacob will take root. Israel will blossom and bud. They will fill the surface of the world with fruit. 
verse:27:7 Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed? 
verse:27:8 In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them. He has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind. 
verse:27:9 Therefore, by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherim and the incense altars shall rise no more. 
verse:27:10 For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its branches. 
verse:27:11 When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off. The women will come and set them on fire, for they are a people of no understanding. Therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them, and he who formed them will show them no favor. 
verse:27:12 It will happen in that day, that HASHEM will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt; and you will be gathered one by one, children of Israel. 
verse:27:13 It will happen in that day that a great shofar will be blown; and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt, shall come; and they will worship HASHEM in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
verse:28:22 Now therefore don't be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard a decree of destruction from my Lord, HASHEM of Hosts, on the whole earth.
verse:28:23 Give ear, and hear my voice! Listen, and hear my speech!

verse:40:2 "Speak comfortably to Jerusalem; and call out to her that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received of HASHEM's hand double for all her sins."
verse:40:3 The voice of one who calls out, "Prepare the way of HASHEM in the wilderness! Make a level highway in the desert for our God. 
verse:40:4 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low. The uneven shall be made level, and the rough places a plain. 
verse:40:5 The glory of HASHEM shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of HASHEM has spoken it." 
verse:40:6 The voice of one saying, "Cry!" One said, "What shall I cry?" "All flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of the field. 
verse:40:7 The grass withers, the flower fades, because HASHEM's breath blows on it. Surely the people are like grass. 
verse:40:8 The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our God stands forever."

verse:40:12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and marked off the sky with his span, and calculated the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? 
verse:40:13 Who has directed the Spirit of HASHEM, or has taught him as his counselor? 
verse:40:14 Who did he take counsel with, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed him the way of understanding? 
verse:40:15 Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket, and are regarded as a speck of dust on a balance. Behold, he lifts up the islands like a very little thing. 
verse:40:16 Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor its animals sufficient for a burnt offering. 
verse:40:17 All the nations are like nothing before him. They are regarded by him as less than nothing, and vanity. 
verse:40:18 To whom then will you liken God? Or what likeness will you compare to him? 
verse:40:19 A workman has cast an image, and the goldsmith overlays it with gold, and casts silver chains for it. 
verse:40:20 He who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot. He seeks a skillful workman to set up an engraved image for him that will not be moved.
verse:40:21 Haven't you known? Haven't you heard, yet? Haven't you been told from the beginning? Haven't you understood from the foundations of the earth? 
verse:40:22 It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in; 
verse:40:23 who brings princes to nothing; who makes the judges of the earth like meaningless. 
verse:40:24 They are planted scarcely. They are sown scarcely. Their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground. He merely blows on them, and they wither, and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble.
verse:40:25 "To whom then will you liken me? Who is my equal?" says the Holy One. 
verse:40:26 Lift up your eyes on high, and see who has created these, who brings out their army by number. He calls them all by name. by the greatness of his might, and because he is strong in power, Not one is lacking.
portion:Isaiah 43:21 - 44:23
verse:43:21 the people which I formed for myself, that they might set forth my praise. 
verse:43:22 Yet you have not called on me, Jacob; but you have been weary of me, Israel. 
verse:43:23 You have not brought me of your sheep for burnt offerings; neither have you honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with offerings, nor wearied you with frankincense. 
verse:43:24 You have bought me no sweet cane with money, nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices; but you have burdened me with your sins. You have wearied me with your iniquities. 
verse:43:25 I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake; and I will not remember your sins. 
verse:43:26 Put me in remembrance. Let us plead together. Set forth your case, that you may be justified. 
verse:43:27 Your first father sinned, and your teachers have transgressed against me. 
verse:43:28 Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary; and I will make Jacob a curse, and Israel an insult."
verse:44:1 Yet listen now, Jacob my servant, and Israel, whom I have chosen. 
verse:44:2 This is what HASHEM who made you, and formed you from the womb, who will help you says: "Don't be afraid, Jacob my servant; and you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen. 
verse:44:3 For I will pour water on him who is thirsty, and streams on the dry ground. I will pour my Spirit on your seed, and my blessing on your offspring: 
verse:44:4 and they will spring up among the grass, as willows by the watercourses. 
verse:44:5 One will say, 'I am HASHEM's;' and another will be called by the name of Jacob; and another will write with his hand 'to HASHEM,' and honor the name of Israel."
verse:44:6 This is what HASHEM, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, HASHEM of Hosts, says: "I am the first, and I am the last; and besides me there is no God. 
verse:44:7 Who is like me? Who will call, and will declare it, and set it in order for me, since I established the ancient people? Let them declare the things that are coming, and that will happen. 
verse:44:8 Don't fear, neither be afraid. Haven't I declared it to you long ago, and shown it? You are my witnesses. Is there a God besides me? Indeed, there is not. I don't know any other Rock."
verse:44:9 Everyone who makes an engraved image is vain. The things that they delight in will not profit. Their own witnesses don't see, nor know, that they may be disappointed. 
verse:44:10 Who has fashioned a god, or molds an image that is profitable for nothing? 
verse:44:11 Behold, all his fellows will be disappointed; and the workmen are mere men. Let them all be gathered together. Let them stand up. They will fear. They will be put to shame together. 
verse:44:12 The blacksmith takes an axe, works in the coals, fashions it with hammers, and works it with his strong arm. He is hungry, and his strength fails; he drinks no water, and is faint. 
verse:44:13 The carpenter stretches out a line. He marks it out with a pencil. He shapes it with planes. He marks it out with compasses, and shapes it like the figure of a man, with the beauty of a man, to reside in a house. 
verse:44:14 He cuts down cedars for himself, and takes the cypress and the oak, and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest. He plants a fir tree, and the rain nourishes it. 
verse:44:15 Then it will be for a man to burn; and he takes some of it, and warms himself. Yes, he burns it, and bakes bread. Yes, he makes a god, and worships it; he makes it an engraved image, and falls down to it. 
verse:44:16 He burns part of it in the fire. With part of it, he eats meat. He roasts a roast, and is satisfied. Yes, he warms himself, and says, "Aha! I am warm. I have seen the fire." 
verse:44:17 The rest of it he makes into a god, even his engraved image. He bows down to it and worships, and prays to it, and says, "Deliver me; for you are my god!" 
verse:44:18 They don't know, neither do they consider: for he has shut their eyes, that they can't see; and their hearts, that they can't understand. 
verse:44:19 No one thinks, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, "I have burned part of it in the fire. Yes, I have also baked bread on its coals. I have roasted meat and eaten it. Shall I make the rest of it into an abomination? Shall I bow down to a tree trunk?" 
verse:44:20 He feeds on ashes. A deceived heart has turned him aside; and he can't deliver his soul, nor say, "Isn't there a lie in my right hand?" 
verse:44:21 Remember these things, Jacob and Israel; for you are my servant. I have formed you. You are my servant. Israel, you will not be forgotten by me. 
verse:44:22 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and, as a cloud, your sins. Return to me, for I have redeemed you.
verse:44:23 Sing, you heavens, for HASHEM has done it! Shout, you lower parts of the earth! Break out into singing, you mountains, O forest, all of your trees, for HASHEM has redeemed Jacob, and will glorify himself in Israel.

verse:49:16 Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me. 
verse:49:17 Your children make haste; your destroyers and those who made you waste shall go forth from you. 
verse:49:18 Lift up your eyes all around, and see: all these gather themselves together, and come to you. As I live," says HASHEM, "you shall surely clothe yourself with them all as with an ornament, and dress yourself with them, like a bride.
verse:49:19 "For, as for your waste and your desolate places, and your land that has been destroyed, surely now you shall be too small for the inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up shall be far away. 
verse:49:20 The children of your bereavement shall yet say in your ears, The place is too small for me; give place to me that I may dwell. 
verse:49:21 Then you will say in your heart, 'Who has conceived these for me, since I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary, an exile, and wandering back and forth? Who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?'"
verse:49:22 Thus says HASHEM GOD, "Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and set up my banner to the peoples; and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.

verse:49:24 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives be delivered?
verse:49:25 But thus says HASHEM, "Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for I will contend with him who contends with you, and I will save your children. 
verse:49:26 I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I, HASHEM, am your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob."
verse:50:1 Thus says HASHEM, "Where is the bill of your mother's divorce, with which I have put her away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities were you sold, and for your transgressions was your mother put away. 
verse:50:2 Why, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it can't redeem? or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stink, because there is no water, and die for thirst. 
verse:50:3 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering."
verse:50:4 HASHEM GOD has given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary: he wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to hear as those who are taught. 
verse:50:5 HASHEM GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away backward. 
verse:50:6 I gave my back to the strikers, and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair; I didn't hide my face from shame and spitting. 
verse:50:7 For HASHEM GOD will help me; therefore I have not been confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be disappointed. 
verse:50:8 He is near who justifies me; who will bring charges against me? Let us stand up together: who is my adversary? Let him come near to me. 
verse:50:9 Behold, HASHEM GOD will help me; who is he who shall condemn me? Behold, all they shall wax old as a garment, the moth shall eat them up. 
verse:50:10 Who is among you who fears HASHEM, who obeys the voice of his servant? He who walks in darkness, and has no light, let him trust in the name of HASHEM, and rely on his God. 
verse:50:11 Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who adorn yourselves with torches around yourselves; walk in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that you have kindled. You shall have this of my hand; you shall lie down in sorrow.
verse:51:1 "Listen to me, you who follow after righteousness, you who seek HASHEM: look to the rock you were cut from, and to the hold of the pit you were dug from. 
verse:51:2 Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who bore you; for when he was but one I called him, and I blessed him, and made him many. 
verse:51:3 For HASHEM has comforted Zion; he has comforted all her waste places, and has made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of HASHEM; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.

verse:55:1 "Come, everyone who thirsts, to the waters! Come, he who has no money, buy, and eat! Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.

verse:51:17 Awake, awake, stand up, Jerusalem, that have drunk at the hand of HASHEM the cup of his wrath; you have drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering, and drained it. 
verse:51:18 There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth; neither is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up. 
verse:51:19 These two things have happened to you. Who will bemoan you? Desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword; how shall I comfort you?

verse:57:16 For I will not contend forever, neither will I be always angry; for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls who I have made. 
verse:57:17 For the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry, and struck him; I hid myself and was angry; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart. 
verse:57:18 I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners. 
verse:57:19 I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is far off and to him who is near," says HASHEM; "and I will heal them."

verse:58:5 Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast, and an acceptable day to HASHEM?

verse:63:4 For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed has come. 
verse:63:5 I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore my own arm brought salvation to me; and my wrath, it upheld me.

verse:66:2 For all these things has my hand made, and so all these things came to be," says HASHEM: "but to this man will I look, even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at my word. 
verse:66:3 He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog's neck; he who offers an offering, as he who offers pig's blood; he who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol. Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations: 
verse:66:4 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears on them; because when I called, no one answered; when I spoke, they didn't listen; but they did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I didn't delight."
verse:66:5 Hear the word of HASHEM, you who tremble at his word: "Your brothers who hate you, who cast you out for my name's sake, have said, 'Let HASHEM be glorified, that we may see your joy;' but it is those who shall be disappointed.

verse:66:9 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth?" says HASHEM: "shall I who cause to bring forth shut the womb?" says your God. 
verse:66:10 "Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn over her; 
verse:66:11 that you may nurse and be satisfied at the comforting breasts; that you may drink deeply, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory."

verse:66:13 As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted in Jerusalem."

verse:66:15 For, behold, HASHEM will come with fire, and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.

verse:66:20 They shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an offering to HASHEM, on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says HASHEM, as the children of Israel bring their offering in a clean vessel into the house of HASHEM. 
verse:66:21 Of them also will I take for priests and for Levites," says HASHEM.
verse:66:22 "For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me," says HASHEM, "so your seed and your name shall remain. 
verse:66:23 It shall happen, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me," says HASHEM.

verse:1:1 Now it happened in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. 
verse:1:2 In the fifth of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity, 
verse:1:3 the word of HASHEM came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Kasdim by the river Chebar; and the hand of HASHEM was there on him. 
verse:1:4 I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with flashing lightning, and a brightness around it, and out of its midst as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire. 
verse:1:5 Out of its midst came the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man. 
verse:1:6 Everyone had four faces, and each one of them had four wings. 
verse:1:7 Their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass. 
verse:1:8 They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and the four of them had their faces and their wings thus: 
verse:1:9 their wings were joined one to another; they didn't turn when they went; each one went straight forward. 
verse:1:10 As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and the four of them had the face of a lion on the right side; and the four of them had the face of an ox on the left side; the four of them also had the face of an eagle. 
verse:1:11 Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above. Two wings of each one touched another, and two covered their bodies. 
verse:1:12 Each one went straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went; they didn't turn when they went. 
verse:1:13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: the fire went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. 
verse:1:14 The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning. 
verse:1:15 Now as I saw the living creatures, behold, one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces of it. 
verse:1:16 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl: and the four of them had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel. 
verse:1:17 When they went, they went in their four directions: they didn't turn when they went. 
verse:1:18 As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes all around. 
verse:1:19 When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. 
verse:1:20 Wherever the spirit was to go, they went; there was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 
verse:1:21 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 
verse:1:22 Over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse, like the awesome crystal to look on, stretched forth over their heads above. 
verse:1:23 Under the expanse were their wings straight, the one toward the other: each one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies. 
verse:1:24 When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of an army: when they stood, they let down their wings. 
verse:1:25 There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings. 
verse:1:26 Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above. 
verse:1:27 I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it all around, from the appearance of his waist and upward; and from the appearance of his waist and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him. 
verse:1:28 As the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of HASHEM. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.
verse:3:12 Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of HASHEM from his place.

verse:28:26 They shall dwell securely therein; yes, they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and shall dwell securely, when I have executed judgments on all those who do them despite all around them; and they shall know that I am HASHEM their God.
verse:29:1 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the word of HASHEM came to me, saying, 
verse:29:2 "Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt. 
verse:29:3 Speak and say, 'Thus says HASHEM GOD: "Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lies in the midst of his rivers, that has said, 'My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.' 
verse:29:4 I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will make the fish of your rivers stick to your scales; and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scales. 
verse:29:5 I'll cast you forth into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers. You'll fall on the open field. You won't be brought together, nor gathered. I have given you for food to the animals of the earth and to the birds of the sky. 
verse:29:6 All the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am HASHEM, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel. 
verse:29:7 When they took hold of you by your hand, you broke, and tore all their shoulders; and when they leaned on you, you broke, and paralyzed all of their thighs." 
verse:29:8 Therefore thus says HASHEM GOD: "Behold, I will bring a sword on you, and will cut off man and animal from you. 
verse:29:9 The land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste; and they shall know that I am HASHEM. Because he has said, 'The river is mine, and I have made it;' 
verse:29:10 therefore, behold, I am against you, and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even to the border of Ethiopia. 
verse:29:11 No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of animal shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years. 
verse:29:12 I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries." 
verse:29:13 For thus says HASHEM GOD: "At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered; 
verse:29:14 and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth; and they shall be there a base kingdom. 
verse:29:15 It shall be the base of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations: and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations. 
verse:29:16 It shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to memory, when they turn to look after them: and they shall know that I am HASHEM GOD."'" 
verse:29:17 It came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first [month], in the first [day] of the month, the word of HASHEM came to me, saying, 
verse:29:18 Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it. 
verse:29:19 Therefore thus says HASHEM GOD: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army. 
verse:29:20 I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he served, because they worked for me, says HASHEM GOD.

verse:37:17 and join them for you one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand.

verse:12:2 In the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Zibiah of Beersheba. 
verse:12:3 Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of the HASHEM all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him. 
verse:12:4 However the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. 
verse:12:5 Jehoash said to the priests, "All the money of the holy things that is brought into the house of HASHEM, in current money, the money of the persons for whom each man is rated, and all the money that it comes into any man's heart to bring into the house of HASHEM, 
verse:12:6 let the priests take it to them, every man from his acquaintance; and they shall repair the breaches of the house, wherever any breach shall be found."
verse:12:7 But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house. 
verse:12:8 Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said to them, "Why don't you repair the breaches of the house? Now therefore take no more money from your treasurers, but deliver it for the breaches of the house."
verse:12:9 The priests consented that they should take no more money from the people, neither repair the breaches of the house. 
verse:12:10 But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of HASHEM: and the priests who kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of HASHEM. 
verse:12:11 It was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of HASHEM. 
verse:12:12 They gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the house of HASHEM: and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, who worked on the house of the HASHEM, 
verse:12:13 and to the masons and the stone cutters, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the breaches of the house of HASHEM, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it. {12:14 But there were not made for the house of HASHEM cups of silver, snuffers, basins, shofars, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of HASHEM; 
verse:12:15 for they gave that to those who did the work, and repaired therewith the house of HASHEM. 
verse:12:16 Moreover they didn't demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work; for they dealt faithfully. 
verse:12:17 The money for the trespass offerings, and the money for the sin offerings, was not brought into the house of HASHEM: it was the priests'.

verse:15:2 Thus says HASHEM of Hosts, 'I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt. 
verse:15:3 Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and don't spare them; but kill both man and woman, infant and nursing baby, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.'" 
verse:15:4 Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah. 
verse:15:5 Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley. 
verse:15:6 Saul said to the Kenites, "Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt." So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 
verse:15:7 Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, that is before Egypt. 
verse:15:8 He took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. 
verse:15:9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the cattle, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and wouldn't utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly. 
verse:15:10 Then the word of HASHEM came to Samuel, saying, 
verse:15:11 "It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments." Samuel was angry; and he cried to HASHEM all night. 
verse:15:12 Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, "Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal." 
verse:15:13 Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, "You are blessed by HASHEM! I have performed the commandment of HASHEM." 
verse:15:14 Samuel said, "Then what does this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the cattle which I hear mean?" 
verse:15:15 Saul said, "They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle, to sacrifice to HASHEM your God. We have utterly destroyed the rest." 
verse:15:16 Then Samuel said to Saul, "Stay, and I will tell you what HASHEM has said to me last night." 
He said to him, "Say on." 
verse:15:17 Samuel said, "Though you were little in your own sight, weren't you made the head of the tribes of Israel? HASHEM anointed you king over Israel; 
verse:15:18 and HASHEM sent you on a journey, and said, 'Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.' 
verse:15:19 Why then didn't you obey the voice of HASHEM, but took the spoils, and did that which was evil in the sight of HASHEM?" 
verse:15:20 Saul said to Samuel, "But I have obeyed the voice of HASHEM, and have gone the way which HASHEM sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. 
verse:15:21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and cattle, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to HASHEM your God in Gilgal." 
verse:15:22 Samuel said, "Has HASHEM as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of HASHEM? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams. 
verse:15:23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because you have rejected the word of HASHEM, he has also rejected you from being king." 
verse:15:24 Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of HASHEM, and your words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice. 
verse:15:25 Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship HASHEM." 
verse:15:26 Samuel said to Saul, "I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of HASHEM, and HASHEM has rejected you from being king over Israel." 
verse:15:27 As Samuel turned about to go away, Saul grabbed the skirt of his robe, and it tore. 
verse:15:28 Samuel said to him, "HASHEM has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you. 
verse:15:29 Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent." 
verse:15:30 Then he said, "I have sinned: yet please honor me now before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and come back with me, that I may worship HASHEM your God." 
verse:15:31 So Samuel went back with Saul; and Saul worshiped HASHEM. 
verse:15:32 Then Samuel said, "Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites!" 
Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, "Surely the bitterness of death is past." 
verse:15:33 Samuel said, "As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless among women!" Samuel cut Agag in pieces before HASHEM in Gilgal. 
verse:15:34 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.

verse:46:12 When the prince shall prepare a freewill offering, a burnt offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to HASHEM, one shall open for him the gate that looks toward the east; and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he does on the Sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate. 
verse:46:13 You shall prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to HASHEM daily: morning by morning you shall prepare it. 
verse:46:14 You shall prepare a meal offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an efah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour; a meal offering to the HASHEM continually by a perpetual ordinance.

verse:46:16 Thus says HASHEM GOD: If the prince give a gift to any of his sons, it is his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance. 
verse:46:17 But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons. 
verse:46:18 Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession; he shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people not be scattered every man from his possession.
